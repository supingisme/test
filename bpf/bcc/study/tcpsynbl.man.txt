NAME
       tcpsynbl - Show the TCP SYN backlog as a histogram. Uses BCC/eBPF.

SYNOPSIS
       tcpsynbl

DESCRIPTION
       This  tool shows the TCP SYN backlog size during SYN arrival as a histogram.  This lets you see how close
       your applications are to hitting the backlog limit and dropping SYNs (causing performance issues with SYN
       retransmits), and is a measure of workload saturation. The histogram shown is measured at the time of SYN
       received, and a separate histogram is shown for each backlog limit.

       This works by tracing  the  tcp_v4_syn_recv_sock()  and  tcp_v6_syn_recv_sock()  kernel  functions  using
       dynamic  instrumentation.  Since these functions may change in future kernels, this tool may need mainte‐
       nance to keep working.

       Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.

REQUIREMENTS
       CONFIG_BPF and BCC.

EXAMPLES
       Show the TCP SYN backlog as a histogram.
              # tcpsynbl

FIELDS
       backlog
              The backlog size when a SYN was received.

       count  The number of times this backlog size was encountered.

       distribution
              An ASCII visualization of the count column.

OVERHEAD
       Inbound SYNs should be relatively low compared to packets and other events, so the overhead of this  tool
       is expected to be negligible.
