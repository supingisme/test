NAME
       tcpconnect - Trace TCP active connections (connect()). Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.

SYNOPSIS
       tcpconnect  [-h]  [-c]  [-t] [-p PID] [-P PORT] [-L] [-u UID] [-U] [--cgroupmap MAPPATH] [--mntnsmap MAP‐
       PATH] [-d]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool traces active TCP connections (eg, via a connect() syscall; accept() are passive  connections).
       This can be useful for general troubleshooting to see what connections are initiated by the local server.

       All connection attempts are traced, even if they ultimately fail.

       This  works  by tracing the kernel tcp_v4_connect() and tcp_v6_connect() functions using dynamic tracing,
       and will need updating to match any changes to these functions.

       When provided with the -d or --dns option, this tool will also correlate  connect  calls  with  the  most
       recent  DNS  query that matches the IP connected.  This feature works by tracing the kernel udp_recvmsg()
       function to collect DNS responses.

       Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.

REQUIREMENTS
       CONFIG_BPF and bcc.

       If using the -d or --dns option, you must have the dnslib and cachetools python packages installed.   You
       can  install  them with pip3 or with apt on Ubuntu 18.04+ using the python3-dnslib and python3-cachetools
       packages.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print usage message.

       -t     Include a timestamp column.

       -c     Count connects per src ip and dest ip/port.

       -p PID Trace this process ID only (filtered in-kernel).

       -P PORT
              Comma-separated list of destination ports to trace (filtered in-kernel).

       -L     Include a LPORT column.

       -U     Include a UID column.

       -u UID Trace this UID only (filtered in-kernel).

       --cgroupmap MAPPATH
              Trace cgroups in this BPF map only (filtered in-kernel).

       --mntnsmap  MAPPATH
              Trace mount namespaces in this BPF map only (filtered in-kernel).

       -d     Shows the most recent DNS query for the IP address in the connect call.  This is likely related to
              the  TCP  connection  details  in the other columns, but is not guaranteed.  This feature works by
              tracing the udp_recvmsg kernel function and tracking DNS responses received  by  the  server.   It
              only supports UDP DNS packets up to 512 bytes in length.  The python code keeps a cache of 10k DNS
              responses in memory for up 24 hours.

              If the time difference in milliseconds between when the system received a DNS response and when  a
              connect  syscall was traced using an IP in that DNS response is greater than 100ms, this tool will
              report this delta after the query.  These deltas should be relatively short for most applications.
              A  long  delay  between  the response and connect could be either anomalous activity or indicate a
              misattribution between the DNS name requested and the IP that the connect syscall is using.

              The -d option may not be used with the count feature (option -c)

EXAMPLES
       Trace all active TCP connections:
              # tcpconnect

       Trace all TCP connects, and include timestamps:
              # tcpconnect -t

       Trace all TCP connects, and include most recent matching DNS query for each connected IP
              # tcpconnect -d

       Trace PID 181 only:
              # tcpconnect -p 181

       Trace ports 80 and 81 only:
              # tcpconnect -P 80,81

       Trace all TCP connects, and include LPORT:
              # tcpconnect -L

       Trace all TCP connects, and include UID:
              # tcpconnect -U

       Trace UID 1000 only:
              # tcpconnect -u 1000

       Count connects per src ip and dest ip/port:
              # tcpconnect -c

       Trace a set of cgroups only (see special_filtering.md from bcc sources for more details):
              # tcpconnect --cgroupmap /sys/fs/bpf/test01

       Trace a set of mount namespaces only (see special_filtering.md from bcc sources for more details):
              # tcpconnect --mntnsmap /sys/fs/bpf/mnt_ns_set

FIELDS
       TIME(s)
              Time of the call, in seconds.

       UID    User ID

       PID    Process ID

       COMM   Process name

       IP     IP address family (4 or 6)

       SADDR  Source IP address.

       LPORT  Source port

       DADDR  Destination IP address.

       DPORT  Destination port

       CONNECTS
              Accumulated active connections since start.

       QUERY  Shows the most recent DNS query for the IP address in the connect call.  This is likely related to
              the TCP connection details in the other columns, but is not guaranteed.

OVERHEAD
       This  traces the kernel tcp_v[46]_connect functions and prints output for each event. As the rate of this
       is generally expected to be low (< 1000/s), the overhead is also expected to be negligible. If  you  have
       an  application  that  is calling a high rate of connect()s, such as a proxy server, then test and under‐
       stand this overhead before use.

       If you are using the -d option to track DNS requests, this tool will trace the udp_recvmsg  function  and
       generate  an  event  for  any  packets  from UDP port 53.  This event contains up to 512 bytes of the UDP
       packet payload.  Typical applications do not extensively use UDP, so the performance overhead of  tracing
       udp_recvmsg  is  expected  to be negligible,   However, if you have an application that receives many UDP
       packets, then you should test and understand the overhead of tracing every received  UDP  message.   Fur‐
       thermore, performance overhead of running this tool on a DNS server is expected to be higher than average
       because all DNS response packets will be copied to userspace.
