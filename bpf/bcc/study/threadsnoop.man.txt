threadsnoop(8)                               System Manager's Manual                              threadsnoop(8)



NAME
       threadsnoop - Trace thread creation via pthread_create(). Uses BCC/eBPF.

SYNOPSIS
       threadsnoop

DESCRIPTION
       threadsnoop  traces calls to pthread_create(), showing this path of thread creation. This can be used for
       workload characterization and discovery, and is a companion to execsnoop(8) which traces execve(2).

       This works by tracing the pthread_create() from libpthread.so.0.  The  path  to  this  library  may  need
       adjusting in the tool source to match your system.

       Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.

REQUIREMENTS
       CONFIG_BPF and BCC.

EXAMPLES
       Trace calls pthread_create():
              # threadsnoop

FIELDS
       TIME(ms)
              Elapsed time since the tool began tracing (in milliseconds).

       PID    The process ID.

       COMM   The process (thread) name.

       FUNC   The  name  of the start routine, if the symbol is available, else a hex address for the start rou‐
              tine address.

OVERHEAD
       Thread creation is expected to be low (<< 1000/s), so the overhead of this tool is expected to be  negli‐
       gible.
