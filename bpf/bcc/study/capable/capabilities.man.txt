NAME
       capabilities - overview of Linux capabilities

DESCRIPTION
       For  the  purpose of performing permission checks, traditional UNIX implementations distinguish two cate‐
       gories of processes: privileged processes (whose effective user ID is 0,  referred  to  as  superuser  or
       root), and unprivileged processes (whose effective UID is nonzero).  Privileged processes bypass all ker‐
       nel permission checks, while unprivileged processes are subject to full permission checking based on  the
       process's credentials (usually: effective UID, effective GID, and supplementary group list).

       Starting  with kernel 2.2, Linux divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser into dis‐
       tinct units, known as capabilities, which can be independently enabled and disabled.  Capabilities are  a
       per-thread attribute.

   Capabilities list
       The following list shows the capabilities implemented on Linux, and the operations or behaviors that each
       capability permits:

       CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL (since Linux 2.6.11)
              Enable and disable kernel auditing; change auditing filter rules;  retrieve  auditing  status  and
              filtering rules.

       CAP_AUDIT_WRITE (since Linux 2.6.11)
              Write records to kernel auditing log.

       CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND (since Linux 3.5)
              Employ features that can block system suspend (epoll(7) EPOLLWAKEUP, /proc/sys/wake_lock).

       CAP_CHOWN
              Make arbitrary changes to file UIDs and GIDs (see chown(2)).

       CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE
              Bypass file read, write, and execute permission checks.  (DAC is an abbreviation of "discretionary
              access control".)

       CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH
              * Bypass file read permission checks and directory read and execute permission checks;
              * Invoke open_by_handle_at(2).


       CAP_FOWNER
              * Bypass permission checks on operations that normally require the file system UID of the  process
                to  match  the UID of the file (e.g., chmod(2), utime(2)), excluding those operations covered by
                CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE and CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH;
              * set extended file attributes (see chattr(1)) on arbitrary files;
              * set Access Control Lists (ACLs) on arbitrary files;
              * ignore directory sticky bit on file deletion;
              * specify O_NOATIME for arbitrary files in open(2) and fcntl(2).

       CAP_FSETID
              Don't clear set-user-ID and set-group-ID permission bits when a file is  modified;  set  the  set-
              group-ID  bit for a file whose GID does not match the file system or any of the supplementary GIDs
              of the calling process.

       CAP_IPC_LOCK
              Lock memory (mlock(2), mlockall(2), mmap(2), shmctl(2)).

       CAP_IPC_OWNER
              Bypass permission checks for operations on System V IPC objects.

       CAP_KILL
              Bypass permission checks for sending signals (see kill(2)).  This includes  use  of  the  ioctl(2)
              KDSIGACCEPT operation.

       CAP_LEASE (since Linux 2.4)
              Establish leases on arbitrary files (see fcntl(2)).

       CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE
              Set the FS_APPEND_FL and FS_IMMUTABLE_FL i-node flags (see chattr(1)).

       CAP_MAC_ADMIN (since Linux 2.6.25)
              Override Mandatory Access Control (MAC).  Implemented for the Smack Linux Security Module (LSM).

       CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE (since Linux 2.6.25)

              Create special files using mknod(2).

       CAP_NET_ADMIN
              Perform various network-related operations:
              * interface configuration;
              * administration of IP firewall, masquerading, and accounting;
              * modify routing tables;

              * use  setsockopt(2)  to  set  the following socket options: SO_DEBUG, SO_MARK, SO_PRIORITY (for a
                priority outside the range 0 to 6), SO_RCVBUFFORCE, and SO_SNDBUFFORCE.

       CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
              Bind a socket to Internet domain privileged ports (port numbers less than 1024).

       CAP_NET_BROADCAST
              (Unused)  Make socket broadcasts, and listen to multicasts.

       CAP_NET_RAW
              * use RAW and PACKET sockets;
              * bind to any address for transparent proxying.

       CAP_SETGID
              Make arbitrary manipulations of process GIDs and supplementary GID list; forge  GID  when  passing
              socket credentials via UNIX domain sockets.

       CAP_SETFCAP (since Linux 2.6.24)
              Set file capabilities.

       CAP_SETPCAP
              If  file  capabilities are not supported: grant or remove any capability in the caller's permitted
              capability set to or from any other process.  (This property of CAP_SETPCAP is not available  when
              the  kernel  is  configured to support file capabilities, since CAP_SETPCAP has entirely different
              semantics for such kernels.)

              If file capabilities are supported: add any capability from the calling thread's bounding  set  to
              its  inheritable set; drop capabilities from the bounding set (via prctl(2) PR_CAPBSET_DROP); make
              changes to the securebits flags.

       CAP_SETUID
              Make arbitrary manipulations of process UIDs (setuid(2), setreuid(2), setresuid(2),  setfsuid(2));
              make forged UID when passing socket credentials via UNIX domain sockets.

                swapon(2), swapoff(2), sethostname(2), and setdomainname(2);

          the value 1.  (See the discussion of the kptr_restrict in proc(5).)

       CAP_WAKE_ALARM (since Linux 3.0)
          Trigger something that will wake up the  system  (set  CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM  and  CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM
          timers).

   Past and current implementation
       A full implementation of capabilities requires that:

       1. For all privileged operations, the kernel must check whether the thread has the required capability in
          its effective set.

       2. The kernel must provide system calls allowing a thread's capability sets to be changed and retrieved.

       3. The file system must support attaching capabilities to an executable file, so  that  a  process  gains
          those capabilities when the file is executed.

       Before  kernel  2.6.24,  only the first two of these requirements are met; since kernel 2.6.24, all three
       requirements are met.

   Thread capability sets
       Each thread has three capability sets containing zero or more of the above capabilities:

       Permitted:
              This is a limiting superset for the effective capabilities that the thread may assume.  It is also
              a limiting superset for the capabilities that may be added to the inheritable set by a thread that
              does not have the CAP_SETPCAP capability in its effective set.

              If a thread drops a capability from its permitted set, it  can  never  reacquire  that  capability
              (unless  it execve(2)s either a set-user-ID-root program, or a program whose associated file capa‐
              bilities grant that capability).

       Inheritable:
              This is a set of capabilities preserved across an  execve(2).   It  provides  a  mechanism  for  a
              process to assign capabilities to the permitted set of the new program during an execve(2).

       Effective:
              This is the set of capabilities used by the kernel to perform permission checks for the thread.

       A  child created via fork(2) inherits copies of its parent's capability sets.  See below for a discussion
       of the treatment of capabilities during execve(2).

       Using capset(2), a thread may manipulate its own capability sets (see below).

       Since Linux 3.2, the file /proc/sys/kernel/cap_last_cap exposes the numerical value of the highest  capa‐
       bility  supported by the running kernel; this can be used to determine the highest bit that may be set in
       a capability set.

   File capabilities
       Since kernel 2.6.24, the kernel supports associating capability sets with an executable file  using  set‐
       cap(8).   The  file  capability  sets  are  stored in an extended attribute (see setxattr(2)) named secu‐
       rity.capability.  Writing to this extended attribute requires the CAP_SETFCAP capability.  The file capa‐
       bility  sets,  in  conjunction  with  the  capability sets of the thread, determine the capabilities of a
       thread after an execve(2).

       The three file capability sets are:

       Permitted (formerly known as forced):
              These capabilities are automatically permitted to the thread, regardless of the thread's inherita‐
              ble capabilities.

       Inheritable (formerly known as allowed):
              This  set  is  ANDed with the thread's inheritable set to determine which inheritable capabilities
              are enabled in the permitted set of the thread after the execve(2).

       Effective:
              This is not a set, but rather just a single bit.  If this bit is set, then during an execve(2) all
              of  the  new  permitted capabilities for the thread are also raised in the effective set.  If this
              bit is not set, then after an execve(2), none of the new permitted  capabilities  is  in  the  new
              effective set.

              Enabling the file effective capability bit implies that any file permitted or inheritable capabil‐
              ity that causes a thread to acquire the corresponding permitted  capability  during  an  execve(2)
              (see  the transformation rules described below) will also acquire that capability in its effective
              set.   Therefore,  when  assigning   capabilities   to   a   file   (setcap(8),   cap_set_file(3),
              cap_set_fd(3)),  if  we  specify  the effective flag as being enabled for any capability, then the
              effective flag must also be specified as enabled for all other capabilities for which  the  corre‐
              sponding permitted or inheritable flags is enabled.

   Transformation of capabilities during execve()
       During  an execve(2), the kernel calculates the new capabilities of the process using the following algo‐
       rithm:

           P'(permitted) = (P(inheritable) & F(inheritable)) |
                           (F(permitted) & cap_bset)

           P'(effective) = F(effective) ? P'(permitted) : 0

           P'(inheritable) = P(inheritable)    [i.e., unchanged]

       where:

           P         denotes the value of a thread capability set before the execve(2)

           P'        denotes the value of a capability set after the execve(2)

           F         denotes a file capability set

           cap_bset  is the value of the capability bounding set (described below).

   Capabilities and execution of programs by root
       In order to provide an all-powerful root using capability sets, during an execve(2):

       1. If a set-user-ID-root program is being executed, or the real user ID of the process is 0  (root)  then
          the file inheritable and permitted sets are defined to be all ones (i.e., all capabilities enabled).

       2. If  a  set-user-ID-root  program  is  being executed, then the file effective bit is defined to be one
          (enabled).

       The upshot of the above rules, combined with the capabilities transformations described  above,  is  that
       when  a  process  execve(2)s  a  set-user-ID-root  program,  or when a process with an effective UID of 0
       execve(2)s a program, it gains all capabilities in its permitted and effective  capability  sets,  except
       those masked out by the capability bounding set.  This provides semantics that are the same as those pro‐
       vided by traditional UNIX systems.

   Capability bounding set
       The capability bounding set is a security mechanism that can be used to limit the capabilities  that  can
       be gained during an execve(2).  The bounding set is used in the following ways:

       * During  an  execve(2), the capability bounding set is ANDed with the file permitted capability set, and
         the result of this operation is assigned to the thread's  permitted  capability  set.   The  capability
         bounding  set  thus  places  a limit on the permitted capabilities that may be granted by an executable
         file.

       * (Since Linux 2.6.25) The capability bounding set acts as a limiting superset for the capabilities  that
         a thread can add to its inheritable set using capset(2).  This means that if a capability is not in the
         bounding set, then a thread can't add this capability to its inheritable set, even if  it  was  in  its
         permitted  capabilities, and thereby cannot have this capability preserved in its permitted set when it
         execve(2)s a file that has the capability in its inheritable set.

       Note that the bounding set masks the file permitted capabilities, but not the inherited capabilities.  If
       a  thread  maintains a capability in its inherited set that is not in its bounding set, then it can still
       gain that capability in its permitted set by executing a file that has the capability  in  its  inherited
       set.

       Depending on the kernel version, the capability bounding set is either a system-wide attribute, or a per-
       process attribute.

       Capability bounding set prior to Linux 2.6.25

       In kernels before 2.6.25, the capability bounding set is a system-wide attribute that affects all threads
       on  the  system.   The bounding set is accessible via the file /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound.  (Confusingly,
       this bit mask parameter is expressed as a signed decimal number in /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound.)

       Only the init process may set capabilities in the capability bounding set; other than that, the superuser
       (more precisely: programs with the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability) may only clear capabilities from this set.

       On  a standard system the capability bounding set always masks out the CAP_SETPCAP capability.  To remove
       this restriction (dangerous!), modify the definition of  CAP_INIT_EFF_SET  in  include/linux/capability.h
       and rebuild the kernel.

       The system-wide capability bounding set feature was added to Linux starting with kernel version 2.2.11.

       Capability bounding set from Linux 2.6.25 onward

       From  Linux 2.6.25, the capability bounding set is a per-thread attribute.  (There is no longer a system-
       wide capability bounding set.)

       The bounding set is inherited at fork(2) from the thread's parent, and is preserved across an execve(2).

       A thread may remove capabilities from its capability bounding  set  using  the  prctl(2)  PR_CAPBSET_DROP
       operation,  provided  it  has  the  CAP_SETPCAP  capability.  Once a capability has been dropped from the
       bounding set, it cannot be restored to that set.  A thread can determine if a capability is in its bound‐
       ing set using the prctl(2) PR_CAPBSET_READ operation.

       Removing  capabilities from the bounding set is supported only if file capabilities are compiled into the
       kernel.  In kernels before Linux 2.6.33, file capabilities were an optional feature configurable via  the
       CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES  option.  Since Linux 2.6.33, the configuration option has been removed
       and file capabilities are always part of the kernel.  When file capabilities are compiled into  the  ker‐
       nel, the init process (the ancestor of all processes) begins with a full bounding set.  If file capabili‐
       ties are not compiled into the kernel, then init begins with  a  full  bounding  set  minus  CAP_SETPCAP,
       because this capability has a different meaning when there are no file capabilities.

       Removing  a capability from the bounding set does not remove it from the thread's inherited set.  However
       it does prevent the capability from being added back into the thread's inherited set in the future.

   Effect of user ID changes on capabilities
       To preserve the traditional semantics for transitions between 0 and nonzero user IDs,  the  kernel  makes
       the  following  changes  to  a thread's capability sets on changes to the thread's real, effective, saved
       set, and file system user IDs (using setuid(2), setresuid(2), or similar):

       1. If one or more of the real, effective or saved set user IDs was previously 0, and as a result  of  the
          UID  changes all of these IDs have a nonzero value, then all capabilities are cleared from the permit‐
          ted and effective capability sets.

       2. If the effective user ID is changed from 0 to nonzero, then all  capabilities  are  cleared  from  the
          effective set.

       3. If  the effective user ID is changed from nonzero to 0, then the permitted set is copied to the effec‐
          tive set.

       4. If the file system user ID is changed from 0 to nonzero (see setfsuid(2)) then the following capabili‐
          ties are cleared from the effective set: CAP_CHOWN, CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH, CAP_FOWNER,
          CAP_FSETID, CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE (since Linux 2.2.30), CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE,  and  CAP_MKNOD  (since  Linux
          2.2.30).  If the file system UID is changed from nonzero to 0, then any of these capabilities that are
          enabled in the permitted set are enabled in the effective set.

       If a thread that has a 0 value for one or more of its user IDs wants to prevent its permitted  capability
       set  being  cleared when it resets all of its user IDs to nonzero values, it can do so using the prctl(2)
       PR_SET_KEEPCAPS operation.

   Programmatically adjusting capability sets
       A thread can retrieve and change its capability sets using the  capget(2)  and  capset(2)  system  calls.
       However,  the  use  of  cap_get_proc(3) and cap_set_proc(3), both provided in the libcap package, is pre‐
       ferred for this purpose.  The following rules govern changes to the thread capability sets:

       1. If the caller does not have the CAP_SETPCAP capability, the new inheritable set must be  a  subset  of
          the combination of the existing inheritable and permitted sets.

       2. (Since  Linux  2.6.25)  The  new  inheritable  set must be a subset of the combination of the existing
          inheritable set and the capability bounding set.

       3. The new permitted set must be a subset of the existing permitted set (i.e.,  it  is  not  possible  to
          acquire permitted capabilities that the thread does not currently have).

       4. The new effective set must be a subset of the new permitted set.

   The securebits flags: establishing a capabilities-only environment
       Starting with kernel 2.6.26, and with a kernel in which file capabilities are enabled, Linux implements a
       set of per-thread securebits flags that can be used to disable special handling of capabilities for UID 0
       (root).  These flags are as follows:

       SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS
              Setting  this  flag allows a thread that has one or more 0 UIDs to retain its capabilities when it
              switches all of its UIDs to a nonzero value.  If this flag is not set,  then  such  a  UID  switch
              causes  the  thread to lose all capabilities.  This flag is always cleared on an execve(2).  (This
              flag provides the same functionality as the older prctl(2) PR_SET_KEEPCAPS operation.)

       SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP
              Setting this flag stops the kernel from adjusting capability sets when the threads's effective and
              file system UIDs are switched between zero and nonzero values.  (See the subsection Effect of User
              ID Changes on Capabilities.)

       SECBIT_NOROOT
              If this bit is set, then the kernel does not grant capabilities when a set-user-ID-root program is
              executed,  or when a process with an effective or real UID of 0 calls execve(2).  (See the subsec‐
              tion Capabilities and execution of programs by root.)

       Each of the above "base" flags has a companion "locked" flag.  Setting any of the "locked" flags is irre‐
       versible,  and has the effect of preventing further changes to the corresponding "base" flag.  The locked
       flags are: SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS_LOCKED, SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP_LOCKED, and SECBIT_NOROOT_LOCKED.

       The  securebits  flags  can  be  modified  and  retrieved  using  the  prctl(2)   PR_SET_SECUREBITS   and
       PR_GET_SECUREBITS operations.  The CAP_SETPCAP capability is required to modify the flags.

       The  securebits  flags  are inherited by child processes.  During an execve(2), all of the flags are pre‐
       served, except SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS which is always cleared.

       An application can use the following call to lock itself, and all of its descendants, into an environment
       where the only way of gaining capabilities is by executing a program with associated file capabilities:

           prctl(PR_SET_SECUREBITS,
                   SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS_LOCKED |
                   SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP |
                   SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP_LOCKED |
                   SECBIT_NOROOT |
                   SECBIT_NOROOT_LOCKED);

CONFORMING TO
       No  standards  govern  capabilities,  but  the  Linux capability implementation is based on the withdrawn
       POSIX.1e draft standard; see ⟨http://wt.tuxomania.net/publications/posix.1e/⟩.

NOTES
       Since kernel 2.5.27, capabilities are an optional kernel component, and can be enabled/disabled  via  the
       CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES kernel configuration option.

       The  /proc/PID/task/TID/status  file  can  be  used  to  view  the  capability  sets  of  a  thread.  The
       /proc/PID/status file shows the capability sets of a process's main thread.  Before Linux  3.8,  nonexis‐
       tent capabilities were shown as being enabled (1) in these sets.  Since Linux 3.8, all non-existent capa‐
       bilities (above CAP_LAST_CAP) are shown as disabled (0).

       The libcap package provides a suite of routines for setting and getting capabilities that  is  more  com‐
       fortable  and less likely to change than the interface provided by capset(2) and capget(2).  This package
       also provides the setcap(8) and getcap(8) programs.  It can be found at
       ⟨http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs⟩.

       Before kernel 2.6.24, and since kernel 2.6.24 if file capabilities are not enabled,  a  thread  with  the
       CAP_SETPCAP  capability  can  manipulate the capabilities of threads other than itself.  However, this is
       only theoretically possible, since no thread ever has CAP_SETPCAP in either of these cases:

       * In the pre-2.6.25 implementation the system-wide capability bounding  set,  /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound,
         always  masks  out this capability, and this can not be changed without modifying the kernel source and
         rebuilding.

       * If file capabilities are disabled in the current implementation, then init starts out with  this  capa‐
         bility  removed from its per-process bounding set, and that bounding set is inherited by all other pro‐
         cesses created on the system.
