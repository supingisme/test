NAME
     bpf -- Berkeley Packet Filter

SYNOPSIS
     device bpf

DESCRIPTION
     The Berkeley Packet Filter	provides a raw interface to data link layers
     in	a protocol independent fashion.	 All packets on	the network, even
     those destined for	other hosts, are accessible through this mechanism.

     The packet	filter appears as a character special device, /dev/bpf.	 After
     opening the device, the file descriptor must be bound to a	specific net-
     work interface with the BIOCSETIF ioctl.  A given interface can be	shared
     by	multiple listeners, and	the filter underlying each descriptor will see
     an	identical packet stream.

     A separate	device file is required	for each minor device.	If a file is
     in	use, the open will fail	and errno will be set to EBUSY.

     Associated	with each open instance	of a bpf file is a user-settable
     packet filter.  Whenever a	packet is received by an interface, all	file
     descriptors listening on that interface apply their filter.  Each de-
     scriptor that accepts the packet receives its own copy.

     The packet	filter will support any	link level protocol that has fixed
     length headers.  Currently, only Ethernet,	SLIP, and PPP drivers have
     been modified to interact with bpf.

     Since packet data is in network byte order, applications should use the
     byteorder(3) macros to extract multi-byte values.

     A packet can be sent out on the network by	writing	to a bpf file descrip-
     tor.  The writes are unbuffered, meaning only one packet can be processed
     per write.	 Currently, only writes	to Ethernets and SLIP links are	sup-
     ported.

BUFFER MODES
     bpf devices deliver packet	data to	the application	via memory buffers
     provided by the application.  The buffer mode is set using	the
     BIOCSETBUFMODE ioctl, and read using the BIOCGETBUFMODE ioctl.

   Buffered read mode
     By	default, bpf devices operate in	the BPF_BUFMODE_BUFFER mode, in	which
     packet data is copied explicitly from kernel to user memory using the
     read(2) system call.  The user process will declare a fixed buffer	size
     that will be used both for	sizing internal	buffers	and for	all read(2)
     operations	on the file.  This size	is queried using the BIOCGBLEN ioctl,
     and is set	using the BIOCSBLEN ioctl.  Note that an individual packet
     larger than the buffer size is necessarily	truncated.

   Zero-copy buffer mode
     bpf devices may also operate in the BPF_BUFMODE_ZEROCOPY mode, in which
     packet data is written directly into two user memory buffers by the ker-
     nel, avoiding both	system call and	copying	overhead.  Buffers are of
     fixed (and	equal) size, page-aligned, and an even multiple	of the page
     size.  The	maximum	zero-copy buffer size is returned by the BIOCGETZMAX
     ioctl.  Note that an individual packet larger than	the buffer size	is
     necessarily truncated.

     The user process registers	two memory buffers using the BIOCSETZBUF
     ioctl, which accepts a struct bpf_zbuf pointer as an argument:

     struct bpf_zbuf {
	     void *bz_bufa;
	     void *bz_bufb;
	     size_t bz_buflen;
     };

     bz_bufa is	a pointer to the userspace address of the first	buffer that
     will be filled, and bz_bufb is a pointer to the second buffer.  bpf will
     then cycle	between	the two	buffers	as they	fill and are acknowledged.

     Each buffer begins	with a fixed-length header to hold synchronization and
     data length information for the buffer:

     struct bpf_zbuf_header {
	     volatile u_int  bzh_kernel_gen; /*	Kernel generation number. */
	     volatile u_int  bzh_kernel_len; /*	Length of data in the buffer. */
	     volatile u_int  bzh_user_gen;   /*	User generation	number.	*/
	     /*	...padding for future use... */
     };

     The header	structure of each buffer, including all	padding, should	be ze-
     roed before it is configured using	BIOCSETZBUF.  Remaining	space in the
     buffer will be used by the	kernel to store	packet data, laid out in the
     same format as with buffered read mode.

     The kernel	and the	user process follow a simple acknowledgement protocol
     via the buffer header to synchronize access to the	buffer:	when the
     header generation numbers,	bzh_kernel_gen and bzh_user_gen, hold the same
     value, the	kernel owns the	buffer,	and when they differ, userspace	owns
     the buffer.

     While the kernel owns the buffer, the contents are	unstable and may
     change asynchronously; while the user process owns	the buffer, its	con-
     tents are stable and will not be changed until the	buffer has been	ac-
     knowledged.

     Initializing the buffer headers to	all 0's	before registering the buffer
     has the effect of assigning initial ownership of both buffers to the ker-
     nel.  The kernel signals that a buffer has	been assigned to userspace by
     modifying bzh_kernel_gen, and userspace acknowledges the buffer and re-
     turns it to the kernel by setting the value of bzh_user_gen to the	value
     of	bzh_kernel_gen.

     In	order to avoid caching and memory re-ordering effects, the user
     process must use atomic operations	and memory barriers when checking for
     and acknowledging buffers:

     #include <machine/atomic.h>

     /*
      *	Return ownership of a buffer to	the kernel for reuse.
      */
     static void
     buffer_acknowledge(struct bpf_zbuf_header *bzh)
     {

	     atomic_store_rel_int(&bzh->bzh_user_gen, bzh->bzh_kernel_gen);
     }

     /*
      *	Check whether a	buffer has been	assigned to userspace by the kernel.
      *	Return true if userspace owns the buffer, and false otherwise.
      */
     static int
     buffer_check(struct bpf_zbuf_header *bzh)
     {

	     return (bzh->bzh_user_gen !=
		 atomic_load_acq_int(&bzh->bzh_kernel_gen));
     }

     The user process may force	the assignment of the next buffer, if any data
     is	pending, to userspace using the	BIOCROTZBUF ioctl.  This allows	the
     user process to retrieve data in a	partially filled buffer	before the
     buffer is full, such as following a timeout; the process must recheck for
     buffer ownership using the	header generation numbers, as the buffer will
     not be assigned to	userspace if no	data was present.

     As	in the buffered	read mode, kqueue(2), poll(2), and select(2) may be
     used to sleep awaiting the	availability of	a completed buffer.  They will
     return a readable file descriptor when ownership of the next buffer is
     assigned to user space.

     In	the current implementation, the	kernel may assign zero,	one, or	both
     buffers to	the user process; however, an earlier implementation main-
     tained the	invariant that at most one buffer could	be assigned to the
     user process at a time.  In order to both ensure progress and high	per-
     formance, user processes should acknowledge a completely processed	buffer
     as	quickly	as possible, returning it for reuse, and not block waiting on
     a second buffer while holding another buffer.

IOCTLS
     The ioctl(2) command codes	below are defined in <net/bpf.h>.  All com-
     mands require these includes:

	     #include <sys/types.h>
	     #include <sys/time.h>
	     #include <sys/ioctl.h>
	     #include <net/bpf.h>

     Additionally, BIOCGETIF and BIOCSETIF require <sys/socket.h> and
     <net/if.h>.

     In	addition to FIONREAD the following commands may	be applied to any open
     bpf file.	The (third) argument to	ioctl(2) should	be a pointer to	the
     type indicated.

     BIOCGBLEN	     (u_int) Returns the required buffer length	for reads on
		     bpf files.

     BIOCSBLEN	     (u_int) Sets the buffer length for	reads on bpf files.
		     The buffer	must be	set before the file is attached	to an
		     interface with BIOCSETIF.	If the requested buffer	size
		     cannot be accommodated, the closest allowable size	will
		     be	set and	returned in the	argument.  A read call will
		     result in EIO if it is passed a buffer that is not	this
		     size.

     BIOCGDLT	     (u_int) Returns the type of the data link layer underly-
		     ing the attached interface.  EINVAL is returned if	no in-
		     terface has been specified.  The device types, prefixed
		     with "DLT_", are defined in <net/bpf.h>.

     BIOCPROMISC     Forces the	interface into promiscuous mode.  All packets,
		     not just those destined for the local host, are pro-
		     cessed.  Since more than one file can be listening	on a
		     given interface, a	listener that opened its interface
		     non-promiscuously may receive packets promiscuously.
		     This problem can be remedied with an appropriate filter.

     BIOCFLUSH	     Flushes the buffer	of incoming packets, and resets	the
		     statistics	that are returned by BIOCGSTATS.

     BIOCGETIF	     (struct ifreq) Returns the	name of	the hardware interface
		     that the file is listening	on.  The name is returned in
		     the ifr_name field	of the ifreq structure.	 All other
		     fields are	undefined.

     BIOCSETIF	     (struct ifreq) Sets the hardware interface	associate with
		     the file.	This command must be performed before any
		     packets can be read.  The device is indicated by name us-
		     ing the ifr_name field of the ifreq structure.  Addition-
		     ally, performs the	actions	of BIOCFLUSH.

     BIOCSRTIMEOUT

     BIOCGRTIMEOUT   (struct timeval) Set or get the read timeout parameter.
		     The argument specifies the	length of time to wait before
		     timing out	on a read request.  This parameter is initial-
		     ized to zero by open(2), indicating no timeout.

     BIOCGSTATS	     (struct bpf_stat) Returns the following structure of
		     packet statistics:

		     struct bpf_stat {
			     u_int bs_recv;    /* number of packets received */
			     u_int bs_drop;    /* number of packets dropped */
		     };

		     The fields	are:

			   bs_recv the number of packets received by the de-
				   scriptor since opened or reset (including
				   any buffered	since the last read call); and

			   bs_drop the number of packets which were accepted
				   by the filter but dropped by	the kernel be-
				   cause of buffer overflows (i.e., the	appli-
				   cation's reads are not keeping up with the
				   packet traffic).

     BIOCIMMEDIATE   (u_int) Enable or disable "immediate mode", based on the
		     truth value of the	argument.  When	immediate mode is en-
		     abled, reads return immediately upon packet reception.
		     Otherwise,	a read will block until	either the kernel buf-
		     fer becomes full or a timeout occurs.  This is useful for
		     programs like rarpd(8) which must respond to messages in
		     real time.	 The default for a new file is off.

     BIOCSETF

     BIOCSETFNR	     (struct bpf_program) Sets the read	filter program used by
		     the kernel	to discard uninteresting packets.  An array of
		     instructions and its length is passed in using the	fol-
		     lowing structure:

		     struct bpf_program	{
			     int bf_len;
			     struct bpf_insn *bf_insns;
		     };

		     The filter	program	is pointed to by the bf_insns field
		     while its length in units of `struct bpf_insn' is given
		     by	the bf_len field.  See section FILTER MACHINE for an
		     explanation of the	filter language.  The only difference
		     between BIOCSETF and BIOCSETFNR is	BIOCSETF performs the
		     actions of	BIOCFLUSH while	BIOCSETFNR does	not.

     BIOCSETWF	     (struct bpf_program) Sets the write filter	program	used
		     by	the kernel to control what type	of packets can be
		     written to	the interface.	See the	BIOCSETF command for
		     more information on the bpf filter	program.

     BIOCVERSION     (struct bpf_version) Returns the major and	minor version
		     numbers of	the filter language currently recognized by
		     the kernel.  Before installing a filter, applications
		     must check	that the current version is compatible with
		     the running kernel.  Version numbers are compatible if
		     the major numbers match and the application minor is less
		     than or equal to the kernel minor.	 The kernel version
		     number is returned	in the following structure:

		     struct bpf_version	{
			     u_short bv_major;
			     u_short bv_minor;
		     };

		     The current version numbers are given by
		     BPF_MAJOR_VERSION and BPF_MINOR_VERSION from <net/bpf.h>.
		     An	incompatible filter may	result in undefined behavior
		     (most likely, an error returned by	ioctl()	or haphazard
		     packet matching).

     BIOCSHDRCMPLT

     BIOCGHDRCMPLT   (u_int) Set or get	the status of the "header complete"
		     flag.  Set	to zero	if the link level source address
		     should be filled in automatically by the interface	output
		     routine.  Set to one if the link level source address
		     will be written, as provided, to the wire.	 This flag is
		     initialized to zero by default.

     BIOCSSEESENT

     BIOCGSEESENT    (u_int) These commands are	obsolete but left for compati-
		     bility.  Use BIOCSDIRECTION and BIOCGDIRECTION instead.
		     Set or get	the flag determining whether locally generated
		     packets on	the interface should be	returned by BPF.  Set
		     to	zero to	see only incoming packets on the interface.
		     Set to one	to see packets originating locally and re-
		     motely on the interface.  This flag is initialized	to one
		     by	default.

     BIOCSDIRECTION

     BIOCGDIRECTION  (u_int) Set or get	the setting determining	whether	incom-
		     ing, outgoing, or all packets on the interface should be
		     returned by BPF.  Set to BPF_D_IN to see only incoming
		     packets on	the interface.	Set to BPF_D_INOUT to see
		     packets originating locally and remotely on the inter-
		     face.  Set	to BPF_D_OUT to	see only outgoing packets on
		     the interface.  This setting is initialized to
		     BPF_D_INOUT by default.

     BIOCSTSTAMP

     BIOCGTSTAMP     (u_int) Set or get	format and resolution of the time
		     stamps returned by	BPF.  Set to BPF_T_MICROTIME,
		     BPF_T_MICROTIME_FAST, BPF_T_MICROTIME_MONOTONIC, or
		     BPF_T_MICROTIME_MONOTONIC_FAST to get time	stamps in
		     64-bit struct timeval format.  Set	to BPF_T_NANOTIME,
		     BPF_T_NANOTIME_FAST, BPF_T_NANOTIME_MONOTONIC, or
		     BPF_T_NANOTIME_MONOTONIC_FAST to get time stamps in
		     64-bit struct timespec format.  Set to BPF_T_BINTIME,
		     BPF_T_BINTIME_FAST, BPF_T_NANOTIME_MONOTONIC, or
		     BPF_T_BINTIME_MONOTONIC_FAST to get time stamps in	64-bit
		     struct bintime format.  Set to BPF_T_NONE to ignore time
		     stamp.  All 64-bit	time stamp formats are wrapped in
		     struct bpf_ts.  The BPF_T_MICROTIME_FAST,
		     BPF_T_NANOTIME_FAST, BPF_T_BINTIME_FAST,
		     BPF_T_MICROTIME_MONOTONIC_FAST,
		     BPF_T_NANOTIME_MONOTONIC_FAST, and
		     BPF_T_BINTIME_MONOTONIC_FAST are analogs of corresponding
		     formats without _FAST suffix but do not perform a full
		     time counter query, so their accuracy is one timer	tick.
		     The BPF_T_MICROTIME_MONOTONIC, BPF_T_NANOTIME_MONOTONIC,
		     BPF_T_BINTIME_MONOTONIC, BPF_T_MICROTIME_MONOTONIC_FAST,
		     BPF_T_NANOTIME_MONOTONIC_FAST, and
		     BPF_T_BINTIME_MONOTONIC_FAST store	the time elapsed since
		     kernel boot.  This	setting	is initialized to
		     BPF_T_MICROTIME by	default.

     BIOCFEEDBACK    (u_int) Set packet	feedback mode.	This allows injected
		     packets to	be fed back as input to	the interface when
		     output via	the interface is successful.  When BPF_D_INOUT
		     direction is set, injected	outgoing packet	is not re-
		     turned by BPF to avoid duplication.  This flag is ini-
		     tialized to zero by default.

     BIOCLOCK	     Set the locked flag on the	bpf descriptor.	 This prevents
		     the execution of ioctl commands which could change	the
		     underlying	operating parameters of	the device.

     BIOCGETBUFMODE

     BIOCSETBUFMODE  (u_int) Get or set	the current bpf	buffering mode;	possi-
		     ble values	are BPF_BUFMODE_BUFFER,	buffered read mode,
		     and BPF_BUFMODE_ZBUF, zero-copy buffer mode.

     BIOCSETZBUF     (struct bpf_zbuf) Set the current zero-copy buffer	loca-
		     tions; buffer locations may be set	only once zero-copy
		     buffer mode has been selected, and	prior to attaching to
		     an	interface.  Buffers must be of identical size, page-
		     aligned, and an integer multiple of pages in size.	 The
		     three fields bz_bufa, bz_bufb, and	bz_buflen must be
		     filled out.  If buffers have already been set for this
		     device, the ioctl will fail.

     BIOCGETZMAX     (size_t) Get the largest individual zero-copy buffer size
		     allowed.  As two buffers are used in zero-copy buffer
		     mode, the limit (in practice) is twice the	returned size.
		     As	zero-copy buffers consume kernel address space,	con-
		     servative selection of buffer size	is suggested, espe-
		     cially when there are multiple bpf	descriptors in use on
		     32-bit systems.

     BIOCROTZBUF     Force ownership of	the next buffer	to be assigned to
		     userspace,	if any data present in the buffer.  If no data
		     is	present, the buffer will remain	owned by the kernel.
		     This allows consumers of zero-copy	buffering to implement
		     timeouts and retrieve partially filled buffers.  In order
		     to	handle the case	where no data is present in the	buffer
		     and therefore ownership is	not assigned, the user process
		     must check	bzh_kernel_gen against bzh_user_gen.

BPF HEADER
     One of the	following structures is	prepended to each packet returned by
     read(2) or	via a zero-copy	buffer:

     struct bpf_xhdr {
	     struct bpf_ts   bh_tstamp;	    /* time stamp */
	     uint32_t	     bh_caplen;	    /* length of captured portion */
	     uint32_t	     bh_datalen;    /* original	length of packet */
	     u_short	     bh_hdrlen;	    /* length of bpf header (this struct
					       plus alignment padding) */
     };

     struct bpf_hdr {
	     struct timeval  bh_tstamp;	    /* time stamp */
	     uint32_t	     bh_caplen;	    /* length of captured portion */
	     uint32_t	     bh_datalen;    /* original	length of packet */
	     u_short	     bh_hdrlen;	    /* length of bpf header (this struct
					       plus alignment padding) */
     };

     The fields, whose values are stored in host order,	and are:

     bh_tstamp	 The time at which the packet was processed by the packet fil-
		 ter.
     bh_caplen	 The length of the captured portion of the packet.  This is
		 the minimum of	the truncation amount specified	by the filter
		 and the length	of the packet.
     bh_datalen	 The length of the packet off the wire.	 This value is inde-
		 pendent of the	truncation amount specified by the filter.
     bh_hdrlen	 The length of the bpf header, which may not be	equal to
		 sizeof(struct bpf_xhdr) or sizeof(struct bpf_hdr).

     The bh_hdrlen field exists	to account for padding between the header and
     the link level protocol.  The purpose here	is to guarantee	proper align-
     ment of the packet	data structures, which is required on alignment	sensi-
     tive architectures	and improves performance on many other architectures.
     The packet	filter ensures that the	bpf_xhdr, bpf_hdr and the network
     layer header will be word aligned.	 Currently, bpf_hdr is used when the
     time stamp	is set to BPF_T_MICROTIME, BPF_T_MICROTIME_FAST,
     BPF_T_MICROTIME_MONOTONIC,	BPF_T_MICROTIME_MONOTONIC_FAST,	or BPF_T_NONE
     for backward compatibility	reasons.  Otherwise, bpf_xhdr is used.	How-
     ever, bpf_hdr may be deprecated in	the near future.  Suitable precautions
     must be taken when	accessing the link layer protocol fields on alignment
     restricted	machines.  (This is not	a problem on an	Ethernet, since	the
     type field	is a short falling on an even offset, and the addresses	are
     probably accessed in a bytewise fashion).

     Additionally, individual packets are padded so that each starts on	a word
     boundary.	This requires that an application has some knowledge of	how to
     get from packet to	packet.	 The macro BPF_WORDALIGN is defined in
     <net/bpf.h> to facilitate this process.  It rounds	up its argument	to the
     nearest word aligned value	(where a word is BPF_ALIGNMENT bytes wide).

     For example, if `p' points	to the start of	a packet, this expression will
     advance it	to the next packet:
	   p = (char *)p + BPF_WORDALIGN(p->bh_hdrlen +	p->bh_caplen)

     For the alignment mechanisms to work properly, the	buffer passed to
     read(2) must itself be word aligned.  The malloc(3) function will always
     return an aligned buffer.

FILTER MACHINE
     A filter program is an array of instructions, with	all branches forwardly
     directed, terminated by a return instruction.  Each instruction performs
     some action on the	pseudo-machine state, which consists of	an accumula-
     tor, index	register, scratch memory store,	and implicit program counter.

     The following structure defines the instruction format:

     struct bpf_insn {
	     u_short code;
	     u_char  jt;
	     u_char  jf;
	     u_long k;
     };

     The k field is used in different ways by different	instructions, and the
     jt	and jf fields are used as offsets by the branch	instructions.  The op-
     codes are encoded in a semi-hierarchical fashion.	There are eight
     classes of	instructions: BPF_LD, BPF_LDX, BPF_ST, BPF_STX,	BPF_ALU,
     BPF_JMP, BPF_RET, and BPF_MISC.  Various other mode and operator bits are
     or'd into the class to give the actual instructions.  The classes and
     modes are defined in <net/bpf.h>.

     Below are the semantics for each defined bpf instruction.	We use the
     convention	that A is the accumulator, X is	the index register, P[]	packet
     data, and M[] scratch memory store.  P[i:n] gives the data	at byte	offset
     "i" in the	packet,	interpreted as a word (n=4), unsigned halfword (n=2),
     or	unsigned byte (n=1).  M[i] gives the i'th word in the scratch memory
     store, which is only addressed in word units.  The	memory store is	in-
     dexed from	0 to BPF_MEMWORDS - 1.	k, jt, and jf are the corresponding
     fields in the instruction definition.  "len" refers to the	length of the
     packet.

     BPF_LD    These instructions copy a value into the	accumulator.  The type
	       of the source operand is	specified by an	"addressing mode" and
	       can be a	constant (BPF_IMM), packet data	at a fixed offset
	       (BPF_ABS), packet data at a variable offset (BPF_IND), the
	       packet length (BPF_LEN),	or a word in the scratch memory	store
	       (BPF_MEM).  For BPF_IND and BPF_ABS, the	data size must be
	       specified as a word (BPF_W), halfword (BPF_H), or byte (BPF_B).
	       The semantics of	all the	recognized BPF_LD instructions follow.

	       BPF_LD+BPF_W+BPF_ABS    A <- P[k:4]
	       BPF_LD+BPF_H+BPF_ABS    A <- P[k:2]
	       BPF_LD+BPF_B+BPF_ABS    A <- P[k:1]
	       BPF_LD+BPF_W+BPF_IND    A <- P[X+k:4]
	       BPF_LD+BPF_H+BPF_IND    A <- P[X+k:2]
	       BPF_LD+BPF_B+BPF_IND    A <- P[X+k:1]
	       BPF_LD+BPF_W+BPF_LEN    A <- len
	       BPF_LD+BPF_IMM	       A <- k
	       BPF_LD+BPF_MEM	       A <- M[k]

     BPF_LDX   These instructions load a value into the	index register.	 Note
	       that the	addressing modes are more restrictive than those of
	       the accumulator loads, but they include BPF_MSH,	a hack for ef-
	       ficiently loading the IP	header length.

	       BPF_LDX+BPF_W+BPF_IMM   X <- k
	       BPF_LDX+BPF_W+BPF_MEM   X <- M[k]
	       BPF_LDX+BPF_W+BPF_LEN   X <- len
	       BPF_LDX+BPF_B+BPF_MSH   X <- 4*(P[k:1]&0xf)

     BPF_ST    This instruction	stores the accumulator into the	scratch	mem-
	       ory.  We	do not need an addressing mode since there is only one
	       possibility for the destination.

	       BPF_ST		       M[k] <- A

     BPF_STX   This instruction	stores the index register in the scratch mem-
	       ory store.

	       BPF_STX		       M[k] <- X

     BPF_ALU   The alu instructions perform operations between the accumulator
	       and index register or constant, and store the result back in
	       the accumulator.	 For binary operations,	a source mode is re-
	       quired (BPF_K or	BPF_X).

	       BPF_ALU+BPF_ADD+BPF_K   A <- A +	k
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_SUB+BPF_K   A <- A -	k
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_MUL+BPF_K   A <- A *	k
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_DIV+BPF_K   A <- A /	k
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_MOD+BPF_K   A <- A %	k
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_AND+BPF_K   A <- A &	k
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_OR+BPF_K    A <- A |	k
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_XOR+BPF_K   A <- A ^	k
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_LSH+BPF_K   A <- A << k
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_RSH+BPF_K   A <- A >> k
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_ADD+BPF_X   A <- A +	X
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_SUB+BPF_X   A <- A -	X
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_MUL+BPF_X   A <- A *	X
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_DIV+BPF_X   A <- A /	X
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_MOD+BPF_X   A <- A %	X
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_AND+BPF_X   A <- A &	X
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_OR+BPF_X    A <- A |	X
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_XOR+BPF_X   A <- A ^	X
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_LSH+BPF_X   A <- A << X
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_RSH+BPF_X   A <- A >> X
	       BPF_ALU+BPF_NEG	       A <- -A

     BPF_JMP   The jump	instructions alter flow	of control.  Conditional jumps
	       compare the accumulator against a constant (BPF_K) or the index
	       register	(BPF_X).  If the result	is true	(or non-zero), the
	       true branch is taken, otherwise the false branch	is taken.
	       Jump offsets are	encoded	in 8 bits so the longest jump is 256
	       instructions.  However, the jump	always (BPF_JA)	opcode uses
	       the 32 bit k field as the offset, allowing arbitrarily distant
	       destinations.  All conditionals use unsigned comparison conven-
	       tions.

	       BPF_JMP+BPF_JA	       pc += k
	       BPF_JMP+BPF_JGT+BPF_K   pc += (A	> k) ? jt : jf
	       BPF_JMP+BPF_JGE+BPF_K   pc += (A	>= k) ?	jt : jf
	       BPF_JMP+BPF_JEQ+BPF_K   pc += (A	== k) ?	jt : jf
	       BPF_JMP+BPF_JSET+BPF_K  pc += (A	& k) ? jt : jf
	       BPF_JMP+BPF_JGT+BPF_X   pc += (A	> X) ? jt : jf
	       BPF_JMP+BPF_JGE+BPF_X   pc += (A	>= X) ?	jt : jf
	       BPF_JMP+BPF_JEQ+BPF_X   pc += (A	== X) ?	jt : jf
	       BPF_JMP+BPF_JSET+BPF_X  pc += (A	& X) ? jt : jf

     BPF_RET   The return instructions terminate the filter program and	spec-
	       ify the amount of packet	to accept (i.e., they return the trun-
	       cation amount).	A return value of zero indicates that the
	       packet should be	ignored.  The return value is either a con-
	       stant (BPF_K) or	the accumulator	(BPF_A).

	       BPF_RET+BPF_A	       accept A	bytes
	       BPF_RET+BPF_K	       accept k	bytes

     BPF_MISC  The miscellaneous category was created for anything that	does
	       not fit into the	above classes, and for any new instructions
	       that might need to be added.  Currently,	these are the register
	       transfer	instructions that copy the index register to the accu-
	       mulator or vice versa.

	       BPF_MISC+BPF_TAX	       X <- A
	       BPF_MISC+BPF_TXA	       A <- X

     The bpf interface provides	the following macros to	facilitate array ini-
     tializers:	BPF_STMT(opcode, operand) and BPF_JUMP(opcode, operand,
     true_offset, false_offset).

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     A set of sysctl(8)	variables controls the behaviour of the	bpf subsystem

     net.bpf.optimize_writers: 0
	     Various programs use BPF to send (but not receive)	raw packets
	     (cdpd, lldpd, dhcpd, dhcp relays, etc. are	good examples of such
	     programs).	 They do not need incoming packets to be send to them.
	     Turning this option on makes new BPF users	to be attached to
	     write-only	interface list until program explicitly	specifies read
	     filter via	pcap_set_filter().  This removes any performance
	     degradation for high-speed	interfaces.

     net.bpf.stats:
	     Binary interface for retrieving general statistics.

     net.bpf.zerocopy_enable: 0
	     Permits zero-copy to be used with net BPF readers.	 Use with cau-
	     tion.

     net.bpf.maxinsns: 512
	     Maximum number of instructions that BPF program can contain.  Use
	     tcpdump(1)	-d option to determine approximate number of instruc-
	     tion for any filter.

     net.bpf.maxbufsize: 524288
	     Maximum buffer size to allocate for packets buffer.

     net.bpf.bufsize: 4096
	     Default buffer size to allocate for packets buffer.

EXAMPLES
     The following filter is taken from	the Reverse ARP	Daemon.	 It accepts
     only Reverse ARP requests.

     struct bpf_insn insns[] = {
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_LD+BPF_H+BPF_ABS, 12),
	     BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP+BPF_JEQ+BPF_K, ETHERTYPE_REVARP, 0, 3),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_LD+BPF_H+BPF_ABS, 20),
	     BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP+BPF_JEQ+BPF_K, REVARP_REQUEST, 0,	1),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_RET+BPF_K, sizeof(struct ether_arp) +
		      sizeof(struct ether_header)),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_RET+BPF_K, 0),
     };

     This filter accepts only IP packets between host 128.3.112.15 and
     128.3.112.35.

     struct bpf_insn insns[] = {
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_LD+BPF_H+BPF_ABS, 12),
	     BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP+BPF_JEQ+BPF_K, ETHERTYPE_IP, 0, 8),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_LD+BPF_W+BPF_ABS, 26),
	     BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP+BPF_JEQ+BPF_K, 0x8003700f, 0, 2),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_LD+BPF_W+BPF_ABS, 30),
	     BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP+BPF_JEQ+BPF_K, 0x80037023, 3, 4),
	     BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP+BPF_JEQ+BPF_K, 0x80037023, 0, 3),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_LD+BPF_W+BPF_ABS, 30),
	     BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP+BPF_JEQ+BPF_K, 0x8003700f, 0, 1),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_RET+BPF_K, (u_int)-1),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_RET+BPF_K, 0),
     };

     Finally, this filter returns only TCP finger packets.  We must parse the
     IP	header to reach	the TCP	header.	 The BPF_JSET instruction checks that
     the IP fragment offset is 0 so we are sure	that we	have a TCP header.

     struct bpf_insn insns[] = {
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_LD+BPF_H+BPF_ABS, 12),
	     BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP+BPF_JEQ+BPF_K, ETHERTYPE_IP, 0, 10),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_LD+BPF_B+BPF_ABS, 23),
	     BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP+BPF_JEQ+BPF_K, IPPROTO_TCP, 0, 8),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_LD+BPF_H+BPF_ABS, 20),
	     BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP+BPF_JSET+BPF_K, 0x1fff, 6, 0),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_LDX+BPF_B+BPF_MSH, 14),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_LD+BPF_H+BPF_IND, 14),
	     BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP+BPF_JEQ+BPF_K, 79, 2, 0),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_LD+BPF_H+BPF_IND, 16),
	     BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP+BPF_JEQ+BPF_K, 79, 0, 1),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_RET+BPF_K, (u_int)-1),
	     BPF_STMT(BPF_RET+BPF_K, 0),
     };

HISTORY
     The Enet packet filter was	created	in 1980	by Mike	Accetta	and Rick
     Rashid at Carnegie-Mellon University.  Jeffrey Mogul, at Stanford,	ported
     the code to BSD and continued its development from	1983 on.  Since	then,
     it	has evolved into the Ultrix Packet Filter at DEC, a STREAMS NIT	module
     under SunOS 4.1, and BPF.

AUTHORS
     Steven McCanne, of	Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, implemented BPF in Sum-
     mer 1990.	Much of	the design is due to Van Jacobson.

     Support for zero-copy buffers was added by	Robert N. M. Watson under con-
     tract to Seccuris Inc.

BUGS
     The read buffer must be of	a fixed	size (returned by the BIOCGBLEN
     ioctl).

     A file that does not request promiscuous mode may receive promiscuously
     received packets as a side	effect of another file requesting this mode on
     the same hardware interface.  This	could be fixed in the kernel with ad-
     ditional processing overhead.  However, we	favor the model	where all
     files must	assume that the	interface is promiscuous, and if so desired,
     must utilize a filter to reject foreign packets.

     Data link protocols with variable length headers are not currently	sup-
     ported.

     The SEESENT, DIRECTION, and FEEDBACK settings have	been observed to work
     incorrectly on some interface types, including those with hardware	loop-
     back rather than software loopback, and point-to-point interfaces.	 They
     appear to function	correctly on a broad range of Ethernet-style inter-
     faces.
