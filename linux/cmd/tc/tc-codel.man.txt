NAME
       CoDel - Controlled-Delay Active Queue Management algorithm

SYNOPSIS
       tc qdisc ... codel [ limit PACKETS ] [ target TIME ] [ interval TIME ] [ ecn | noecn ]


DESCRIPTION
       CoDel (pronounced "coddle") is an adaptive "no-knobs" active queue management algorithm (AQM) scheme that
       was developed to address the shortcomings of RED and its variants. It was developed  with  the  following
       goals in mind:
        o It should be parameterless.
        o It should keep delays low while permitting bursts of traffic.
        o It should control delay.
        o It should adapt dynamically to changing link rates with no impact on utilization.
        o It should be simple and efficient and should scale from simple to complex routers.


ALGORITHM
       CoDel comes with three major innovations. Instead of using queue size or queue average, it uses the local
       minimum queue as a measure of the standing/persistent queue.  Second, it  uses  a  single  state-tracking
       variable  of the minimum delay to see where it is relative to the standing queue delay. Third, instead of
       measuring queue size in bytes or packets, it is measured in packet-sojourn time in the queue.

       CoDel measures the minimum local queue delay (i.e. standing queue delay) and compares it to the value  of
       the  given  acceptable queue delay target.  As long as the minimum queue delay is less than target or the
       buffer contains fewer than MTU worth of bytes, packets are not dropped.  Codel  enters  a  dropping  mode
       when the minimum queue delay has exceeded target for a time greater than interval.  In this mode, packets
       are dropped at different drop times which is set by a control law.  The  control  law  ensures  that  the
       packet  drops  cause a linear change in the throughput. Once the minimum delay goes below target, packets
       are no longer dropped.

       Additional details can be found in the paper cited below.


PARAMETERS
   limit
       hard limit on the real queue size. When this limit is reached, incoming packets are dropped. If the value
       is lowered, packets are dropped so that the new limit is met. Default is 1000 packets.


   target
       is  the  acceptable minimum standing/persistent queue delay. This minimum delay is identified by tracking
       the local minimum queue delay that packets experience.  Default and recommended value is 5ms.


   interval
       is used to ensure that the measured minimum delay does not become too stale. The minimum  delay  must  be
       experienced  in  the  last epoch of length interval.  It should be set on the order of the worst-case RTT
       through the bottleneck to give endpoints sufficient time to react. Default value is 100ms.


   ecn | noecn
       can be used to mark packets instead of dropping them. If ecn has been enabled, noecn can be used to  turn
       it off and vice-a-versa. By default, ecn is turned off.
