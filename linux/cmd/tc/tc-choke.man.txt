NAME
       choke - choose and keep scheduler

SYNOPSIS
       tc  qdisc  ...  choke limit packets min packets max packets avpkt bytes burst packets [ ecn ] [ bandwidth
       rate ] probability chance


DESCRIPTION
       CHOKe (CHOose and Keep for responsive flows, CHOose and Kill for unresponsive flows) is a classless qdisc
       designed  to both identify and penalize flows that monopolize the queue. CHOKe is a variation of RED, and
       the configuration is similar to RED.


ALGORITHM
       Once the queue hits a certain average length, a random packet is drawn from the queue. If both the to-be-
       queued  and  the  drawn packet belong to the same flow, both packets are dropped. Otherwise, if the queue
       length is still below the maximum length, the new packet has a configurable chance of being marked (which
       may  mean  dropped).  If the queue length exceeds max, the new packet will always be marked (or dropped).
       If the queue length exceeds limit, the new packet is always dropped.

       The marking probability computation is the same as used by the RED qdisc.


PARAMETERS
       The parameters are the same as for RED, except that RED uses bytes whereas choke counts packets. See  tc-
       red(8) for a description.
