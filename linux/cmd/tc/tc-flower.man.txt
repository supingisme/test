DESCRIPTION
       The flower filter matches flows to the set of keys specified and assigns an arbitrarily chosen  class  ID
       to packets belonging to them. Additionally (or alternatively) an action from the generic action framework
       may be called.

OPTIONS
       action ACTION_SPEC
              Apply an action from the generic actions framework on matching packets.

       classid CLASSID
              Specify a class to pass matching packets on to.  CLASSID is in the form X:Y, while  X  and  Y  are
              interpreted as numbers in hexadecimal format.

       indev ifname
              Match  on incoming interface name. Obviously this makes sense only for forwarded flows.  ifname is
              the name of an interface which must exist at the time of tc invocation.

       skip_sw
              Do not process filter by software. If hardware has no offload support for this filter, or TC  off‐
              load is not enabled for the interface, operation will fail.

       skip_hw
              Do not process filter by hardware.

       dst_mac MASKED_LLADDR
       src_mac MASKED_LLADDR
              Match  on  source or destination MAC address.  A mask may be optionally provided to limit the bits
              of the address which are matched. A mask is provided by following the address  with  a  slash  and
              then  the  mask.  It may be provided in LLADDR format, in which case it is a bitwise mask, or as a
              number of high bits to match. If the mask is missing then a match on all bits is assumed.

       vlan_id VID
              Match on vlan tag id.  VID is an unsigned 12bit value in decimal format.

       vlan_prio PRIORITY
              Match on vlan tag priority.  PRIORITY is an unsigned 3bit value in decimal format.

       vlan_ethtype VLAN_ETH_TYPE
              Match on layer three protocol.  VLAN_ETH_TYPE may be either ipv4, ipv6 or an unsigned 16bit  value
              in hexadecimal format. To match on QinQ packet, it must be 802.1Q or 802.1AD.

       cvlan_id VID
              Match on QinQ inner vlan tag id.  VID is an unsigned 12bit value in decimal format.

       cvlan_prio PRIORITY
              Match on QinQ inner vlan tag priority.  PRIORITY is an unsigned 3bit value in decimal format.

       cvlan_ethtype VLAN_ETH_TYPE
              Match  on  QinQ layer three protocol.  VLAN_ETH_TYPE may be either ipv4, ipv6 or an unsigned 16bit
              value in hexadecimal format.

       ip_proto IP_PROTO
              Match on layer four protocol.  IP_PROTO may be tcp, udp, sctp, icmp, icmpv6 or  an  unsigned  8bit
              value in hexadecimal format.

       ip_tos MASKED_IP_TOS
              Match on ipv4 TOS or ipv6 traffic-class - eight bits in hexadecimal format.  A mask may be option‐
              ally provided to limit the bits which are matched. A mask is provided by following the value  with
              a slash and then the mask. If the mask is missing then a match on all bits is assumed.

       ip_ttl MASKED_IP_TTL
              Match  on ipv4 TTL or ipv6 hop-limit  - eight bits value in decimal or hexadecimal format.  A mask
              may be optionally provided to limit the bits which are matched. Same logic is used for the mask as
              with matching on ip_tos.

       dst_ip PREFIX
       src_ip PREFIX
              Match on source or destination IP address.  PREFIX must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address, depending
              on the protocol option to tc filter, optionally followed by a slash and the prefix length.  If the
              prefix is missing, tc assumes a full-length host match.

       dst_port NUMBER
       src_port NUMBER
              Match  on  layer  4 protocol source or destination port number. Only available for ip_proto values
              udp, tcp and sctp which have to be specified in beforehand.

       tcp_flags MASKED_TCP_FLAGS
              Match on TCP flags represented as 12bit bitfield in in hexadecimal format.  A mask may be  option‐
              ally  provided to limit the bits which are matched. A mask is provided by following the value with
              a slash and then the mask. If the mask is missing then a match on all bits is assumed.

       type MASKED_TYPE
       code MASKED_CODE
              Match on ICMP type or code. A mask may be optionally provided to limit the  bits  of  the  address
              which are matched. A mask is provided by following the address with a slash and then the mask. The
              mask must be as a number which represents a bitwise mask If the mask is missing then  a  match  on
              all  bits  is assumed.  Only available for ip_proto values icmp and icmpv6 which have to be speci‐
              fied in beforehand.

       arp_tip IPV4_PREFIX
       arp_sip IPV4_PREFIX
              Match on ARP or RARP sender or target IP address.   IPV4_PREFIX  must  be  a  valid  IPv4  address
              optionally followed by a slash and the prefix length. If the prefix is missing, tc assumes a full-
              length host match.

       arp_op ARP_OP
              Match on ARP or RARP operation.  ARP_OP may be request, reply or an integer value 0, 1  or  2.   A
              mask  may  be  optionally provided to limit the bits of the operation which are matched. A mask is
              provided by following the address with a slash and then  the  mask.  It  may  be  provided  as  an
              unsigned  8 bit value representing a bitwise mask. If the mask is missing then a match on all bits
              is assumed.

       arp_sha MASKED_LLADDR
       arp_tha MASKED_LLADDR
              Match on ARP or RARP sender or target MAC address.  A mask may be optionally provided to limit the
              bits  of  the  address which are matched. A mask is provided by following the address with a slash
              and then the mask. It may be provided in LLADDR format, in which case it is a bitwise mask, or  as
              a number of high bits to match. If the mask is missing then a match on all bits is assumed.

       enc_key_id NUMBER
       enc_dst_ip PREFIX
       enc_src_ip PREFIX
       enc_dst_port NUMBER
       enc_tos NUMBER
       enc_ttl NUMBER
              Match  on IP tunnel metadata. Key id NUMBER is a 32 bit tunnel key id (e.g. VNI for VXLAN tunnel).
              PREFIX must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address optionally followed by a slash and the prefix  length.
              If  the  prefix  is missing, tc assumes a full-length host match.  Dst port NUMBER is a 16 bit UDP
              dst port. Tos NUMBER is an 8 bit tos (dscp+ecn) value, ttl NUMBER is an 8 bit time-to-live value.

       ip_flags IP_FLAGS
              IP_FLAGS may be either frag, nofrag, firstfrag or nofirstfrag where frag and nofrag could be  used
              to match on fragmented packets or not, respectively. firstfrag and nofirstfrag can be used to fur‐
              ther distinguish fragmented packet. firstfrag can be used to indicate the first fragmented packet.
              nofirstfrag can be used to indicates subsequent fragmented packets or non-fragmented packets.

NOTES
       As stated above where applicable, matches of a certain layer implicitly depend on the matches of the next
       lower layer. Precisely, layer one and two matches (indev,  dst_mac and src_mac) have no dependency, layer
       three  matches (ip_proto, dst_ip, src_ip, arp_tip, arp_sip, arp_op, arp_tha, arp_sha and ip_flags) depend
       on the protocol option of tc filter, layer four port matches (dst_port and src_port) depend  on  ip_proto
       being  set  to tcp, udp or sctp, and finally ICMP matches (code and type) depend on ip_proto being set to
       icmp or icmpv6.

       There can be only used one mask per one prio. If user needs to specify different mask, he has to use dif‐
       ferent prio.
