FEXECVE(3)                            Linux Programmer's Manual                           FEXECVE(3)



NAME
       fexecve - execute program specified via file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int fexecve(int fd, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fexecve():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       fexecve()  performs  the same task as execve(2), with the difference that the file to be exe‐
       cuted is specified via a file descriptor, fd, rather than via a pathname.  The file  descrip‐
       tor fd must be opened read-only, and the caller must have permission to execute the file that
       it refers to.

RETURN VALUE
       A successful call to fexecve() never returns.  On error, the function returns, with a  result
       value of -1, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       Errors are as for execve(2), with the following additions:

       EINVAL fd is not a valid file descriptor, or argv is NULL, or envp is NULL.

       ENOSYS The /proc file system could not be accessed.

VERSIONS
       fexecve() is implemented since glibc 2.3.2.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.  This function is not specified in POSIX.1-2001, and is not widely available on
       other systems.

NOTES
       On Linux, fexecve() is implemented using the proc(5)  file  system,  so  /proc  needs  to  be
       mounted and available at the time of the call.
