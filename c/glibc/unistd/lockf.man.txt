LOCKF(3)                              Linux Programmer's Manual                             LOCKF(3)



NAME
       lockf - apply, test or remove a POSIX lock on an open file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int lockf(int fd, int cmd, off_t len);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       lockf():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 ||
           _XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

DESCRIPTION
       Apply, test or remove a POSIX lock on a section of an open file.  The file  is  specified  by
       fd,  a  file descriptor open for writing, the action by cmd, and the section consists of byte
       positions pos..pos+len-1 if len is positive, and pos-len..pos-1 if len is negative, where pos
       is  the  current file position, and if len is zero, the section extends from the current file
       position to infinity, encompassing the present and  future  end-of-file  positions.   In  all
       cases, the section may extend past current end-of-file.

       On Linux, lockf() is just an interface on top of fcntl(2) locking.  Many other systems imple‐
       ment lockf() in this way, but note that POSIX.1-2001 leaves the relationship between  lockf()
       and fcntl(2) locks unspecified.  A portable application should probably avoid mixing calls to
       these interfaces.

       Valid operations are given below:

       F_LOCK Set an exclusive lock on the specified section of the file.  If (part of) this section
              is  already locked, the call blocks until the previous lock is released.  If this sec‐
              tion overlaps an earlier locked section, both are merged.  File locks are released  as
              soon  as  the  process  holding the locks closes some file descriptor for the file.  A
              child process does not inherit these locks.

       F_TLOCK
              Same as F_LOCK but the call never blocks and returns an error instead if the  file  is
              already locked.

       F_ULOCK
              Unlock the indicated section of the file.  This may cause a locked section to be split
              into two locked sections.

       F_TEST Test the lock: return 0 if the  specified  section  is  unlocked  or  locked  by  this
              process;  return  -1,  set  errno to EAGAIN (EACCES on some other systems), if another
              process holds a lock.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EACCES or EAGAIN
              The file is locked and F_TLOCK or F_TEST was specified, or the operation is prohibited
              because the file has been memory-mapped by another process.

       EBADF  fd  is  not  an  open  file  descriptor;  or  cmd is F_LOCK or F_TLOCK and fd is not a
              writable file descriptor.

       EDEADLK
              The command was F_LOCK and this lock operation would cause a deadlock.

       EINVAL An invalid operation was specified in fd.

       ENOLCK Too many segment locks open, lock table is full.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.
