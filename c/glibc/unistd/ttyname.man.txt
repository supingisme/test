TTYNAME(3)                            Linux Programmer's Manual                           TTYNAME(3)



NAME
       ttyname, ttyname_r - return name of a terminal

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       char *ttyname(int fd);

       int ttyname_r(int fd, char *buf, size_t buflen);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  ttyname()  returns  a  pointer to the null-terminated pathname of the terminal
       device that is open on the file descriptor fd, or NULL on error (for example, if  fd  is  not
       connected to a terminal).  The return value may point to static data, possibly overwritten by
       the next call.  The function ttyname_r() stores this pathname in the  buffer  buf  of  length
       buflen.

RETURN VALUE
       The  function  ttyname()  returns  a  pointer  to  a  pathname on success.  On error, NULL is
       returned, and errno is set appropriately.  The function ttyname_r() returns 0 on success, and
       an error number upon error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  Bad file descriptor.

       ENOTTY File descriptor does not refer to a terminal device.

       ERANGE (ttyname_r()) buflen was too small to allow storing the pathname.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The ttyname() function is not thread-safe.

       The ttyname_r() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       4.2BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
