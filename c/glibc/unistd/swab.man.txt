SWAB(3)                               Linux Programmer's Manual                              SWAB(3)



NAME
       swab - swap adjacent bytes

SYNOPSIS
       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE       /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <unistd.h>

       void swab(const void *from, void *to, ssize_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  swab() function copies n bytes from the array pointed to by from to the array pointed to
       by to, exchanging adjacent even and odd bytes.   This  function  is  used  to  exchange  data
       between machines that have different low/high byte ordering.

       This  function  does  nothing when n is negative.  When n is positive and odd, it handles n-1
       bytes as above, and does something unspecified with the last byte.  (In other words, n should
       be even.)

RETURN VALUE
       The swab() function returns no value.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
