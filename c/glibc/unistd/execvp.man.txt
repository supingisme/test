NAME
       execl, execlp, execle, execv, execvp, execvpe - execute a file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       extern char **environ;

       int execl(const char *path, const char *arg, ...);
       int execlp(const char *file, const char *arg, ...);
       int execle(const char *path, const char *arg,
                  ..., char * const envp[]);
       int execv(const char *path, char *const argv[]);
       int execvp(const char *file, char *const argv[]);
       int execvpe(const char *file, char *const argv[],
                   char *const envp[]);

DESCRIPTION
       The  exec()  family  of functions replaces the current process image with a new process image.  The func‐
       tions described in this manual page are front-ends for execve(2).  (See the manual page for execve(2) for
       further details about the replacement of the current process image.)

       The initial argument for these functions is the name of a file that is to be executed.

       The  const  char *arg  and  subsequent  ellipses  in the execl(), execlp(), and execle() functions can be
       thought of as arg0, arg1, ..., argn.  Together they describe a list of one or more pointers to  null-ter‐
       minated  strings that represent the argument list available to the executed program.  The first argument,
       by convention, should point to the filename associated with the file being executed.  The list  of  argu‐
       ments must be terminated by a NULL pointer, and, since these are variadic functions, this pointer must be
       cast (char *) NULL.

       The execv(), execvp(), and execvpe() functions provide an array of pointers  to  null-terminated  strings
       that represent the argument list available to the new program.  The first argument, by convention, should
       point to the filename associated with the file being executed.  The array of pointers must be  terminated
       by a NULL pointer.

       The  execle() and execvpe() functions allow the caller to specify the environment of the executed program
       via the argument envp.  The envp argument is an array of pointers to null-terminated strings and must  be
       terminated  by  a  NULL pointer.  The other functions take the environment for the new process image from
       the external variable environ in the calling process.

   Special semantics for execlp() and execvp()
       The execlp(), execvp(), and execvpe() functions duplicate the actions of the shell in  searching  for  an
       executable  file if the specified filename does not contain a slash (/) character.  The file is sought in
       the colon-separated list of directory pathnames specified in the  PATH  environment  variable.   If  this
       variable  isn't defined, the path list defaults to the current directory followed by the list of directo‐
       ries returned by confstr(_CS_PATH).  (This confstr(3) call typically returns the value "/bin:/usr/bin".)

       If the specified filename includes a slash character, then PATH is ignored, and the file at the specified
       pathname is executed.

       In addition, certain errors are treated specially.

       If  permission  is  denied for a file (the attempted execve(2) failed with the error EACCES), these func‐
       tions will continue searching the rest of the search path.  If no other file is found, however, they will
       return with errno set to EACCES.

       If  the  header of a file isn't recognized (the attempted execve(2) failed with the error ENOEXEC), these
       functions will execute the shell (/bin/sh) with the path of the file as its  first  argument.   (If  this
       attempt fails, no further searching is done.)

RETURN VALUE
       The  exec()  functions return only if an error has occurred.  The return value is -1, and errno is set to
       indicate the error.

ERRORS
       All of these functions may fail and set errno for any of the errors specified for execve(2).

VERSIONS
       The execvpe() function first appeared in glibc 2.11.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

       The execvpe() function is a GNU extension.

NOTES
       On some other systems, the default path (used when the environment does not contain  the  variable  PATH)
       has the current working directory listed after /bin and /usr/bin, as an anti-Trojan-horse measure.  Linux
       uses here the traditional "current directory first" default path.

       The behavior of execlp() and execvp() when errors occur while attempting to execute the file is  historic
       practice, but has not traditionally been documented and is not specified by the POSIX standard.  BSD (and
       possibly other systems) do an automatic sleep and retry if ETXTBSY is encountered.  Linux treats it as  a
       hard error and returns immediately.

       Traditionally, the functions execlp() and execvp() ignored all errors except for the ones described above
       and ENOMEM and E2BIG, upon which they returned.  They now  return  if  any  error  other  than  the  ones
       described above occurs.
