NAME
       profil - execution time profile

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int profil(unsigned short *buf, size_t bufsiz,
                  size_t offset, unsigned int scale);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       profil(): _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)

DESCRIPTION
       This routine provides a means to find out in what areas your program spends most of its time.
       The argument buf points to bufsiz bytes of core.  Every virtual 10 milliseconds,  the  user's
       program  counter (PC) is examined: offset is subtracted and the result is multiplied by scale
       and divided by 65536.  If the resulting value is less than  bufsiz,  then  the  corresponding
       entry in buf is incremented.  If buf is NULL, profiling is disabled.

RETURN VALUE
       Zero is always returned.

CONFORMING TO
       Similar to a call in SVr4 (but not POSIX.1-2001).

BUGS
       profil()  cannot  be  used  on  a  program  that  also  uses ITIMER_PROF interval timers (see
       setitimer(2)).

       True kernel profiling provides more accurate results.  Libc 4.4 contained a kernel patch pro‐
       viding a system call profil.
