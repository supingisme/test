GETPASS(3)                            Linux Programmer's Manual                           GETPASS(3)



NAME
       getpass - get a password

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       char *getpass( const char *prompt);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       getpass():
           Since glibc 2.2.2:
               _BSD_SOURCE ||
                   (_XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 ||
                       _XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED) &&
                   !(_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600)
           Before glibc 2.2.2:
               none

DESCRIPTION
       This  function is obsolete.  Do not use it.  If you want to read input without terminal echo‐
       ing enabled, see the description of the ECHO flag in termios(3).

       The getpass() function opens /dev/tty (the controlling terminal of the process), outputs  the
       string  prompt,  turns  off  echoing,  reads one line (the "password"), restores the terminal
       state and closes /dev/tty again.

RETURN VALUE
       The function getpass() returns a pointer to a static buffer containing  (the  first  PASS_MAX
       bytes  of) the password without the trailing newline, terminated by a null byte ('\0').  This
       buffer may be overwritten by a following call.  On error, the  terminal  state  is  restored,
       errno is set appropriately, and NULL is returned.

ERRORS
       The function may fail if

       ENXIO  The process does not have a controlling terminal.

FILES
       /dev/tty

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The getpass() function is not thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       Present in SUSv2, but marked LEGACY.  Removed in POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       For  libc4  and  libc5,  the  prompt  is not written to /dev/tty but to stderr.  Moreover, if
       /dev/tty cannot be opened, the password is read from stdin.  The static buffer has length 128
       so  that  only the first 127 bytes of the password are returned.  While reading the password,
       signal generation (SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP) is disabled and the corresponding char‐
       acters (usually control-C, control-\, control-Z and control-Y) are transmitted as part of the
       password.  Since libc 5.4.19 also line editing is disabled, so that also  backspace  and  the
       like will be seen as part of the password.

       For glibc2, if /dev/tty cannot be opened, the prompt is written to stderr and the password is
       read from stdin.  There is no limit on the length of the password.  Line editing is not  dis‐
       abled.

       According  to  the  SUSv2,  the value of PASS_MAX must be defined in <limits.h> in case it is
       smaller than 8, and can in  any  case  be  obtained  using  sysconf(_SC_PASS_MAX).   However,
       POSIX.2 withdraws the constants PASS_MAX and _SC_PASS_MAX, and the function getpass().  Libc4
       and libc5 have never supported PASS_MAX or _SC_PASS_MAX.   Glibc2  accepts  _SC_PASS_MAX  and
       returns BUFSIZ (e.g., 8192).

BUGS
       The calling process should zero the password as soon as possible to avoid leaving the cleart‐
       ext password visible in the process's address space.
