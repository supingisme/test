NAME
       ttyslot - find the slot of the current user's terminal in some file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>    /* on BSD-like systems, and Linux */
       #include <stdlib.h>    /* on System V-like systems */

       int ttyslot(void);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       ttyslot():
           _BSD_SOURCE ||
           _XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_ < 500 && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

DESCRIPTION
       The legacy function ttyslot() returns the index of the current user's entry in some file.

       Now "What file?" you ask.  Well, let's first look at some history.

   Ancient history
       There  used  to  be a file /etc/ttys in UNIX V6, that was read by the init(8) program to find
       out what to do with each terminal line.  Each line consisted of three characters.  The  first
       character  was either '0' or '1', where '0' meant "ignore".  The second character denoted the
       terminal: '8' stood for "/dev/tty8".  The third character was an argument to  getty(8)  indi‐
       cating  the  sequence of line speeds to try ('-' was: start trying 110 baud).  Thus a typical
       line was "18-".  A hang on some line was solved by changing the '1' to a '0', signaling init,
       changing back again, and signaling init again.

       In  UNIX  V7  the  format was changed: here the second character was the argument to getty(8)
       indicating the sequence of line speeds to try ('0' was: cycle through 300-1200-150-110  baud;
       '4'  was  for the on-line console DECwriter) while the rest of the line contained the name of
       the tty.  Thus a typical line was "14console".

       Later systems have more elaborate syntax.  System V-like systems have /etc/inittab instead.

   Ancient history (2)
       On the other hand, there is the file /etc/utmp listing the people currently logged in.  It is
       maintained  by  login(1).   It  has  a  fixed size, and the appropriate index in the file was
       determined by login(1) using the ttyslot() call to find the number of the line  in  /etc/ttys
       (counting from 1).

   The semantics of ttyslot
       Thus,  the  function  ttyslot()  returns the index of the controlling terminal of the calling
       process in the file /etc/ttys, and that is (usually) the same as the index of the  entry  for
       the  current user in the file /etc/utmp.  BSD still has the /etc/ttys file, but System V-like
       systems do not, and hence cannot refer to it.  Thus, on such systems the  documentation  says
       that ttyslot() returns the current user's index in the user accounting data base.

RETURN VALUE
       If  successful,  this  function returns the slot number.  On error (e.g., if none of the file
       descriptors 0, 1 or 2 is associated with a terminal that occurs in this data base) it returns
       0 on UNIX V6 and V7 and BSD-like systems, but -1 on System V-like systems.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The ttyslot() function calls thread-unsafe function getttyent(), so it is not thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       SUSv1; marked as LEGACY in SUSv2; removed in POSIX.1-2001.  SUSv2 requires -1 on error.

NOTES
       The  utmp  file is found various places on various systems, such as /etc/utmp, /var/adm/utmp,
       /var/run/utmp.

       The glibc2 implementation of this function reads the file _PATH_TTYS, defined  in  <ttyent.h>
       as "/etc/ttys".  It returns 0 on error.  Since Linux systems do not usually have "/etc/ttys",
       it will always return 0.

       Minix also has fttyslot(fd).
