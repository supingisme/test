GETHOSTID(3)                          Linux Programmer's Manual                         GETHOSTID(3)



NAME
       gethostid, sethostid - get or set the unique identifier of the current host

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       long gethostid(void);
       int sethostid(long hostid);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       gethostid():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 || _XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
       sethostid():
           _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)

DESCRIPTION
       gethostid()  and  sethostid() respectively get or set a unique 32-bit identifier for the cur‐
       rent machine.  The 32-bit identifier is intended to be unique among all UNIX systems in exis‐
       tence.   This  normally  resembles the Internet address for the local machine, as returned by
       gethostbyname(3), and thus usually never needs to be set.

       The sethostid() call is restricted to the superuser.

RETURN VALUE
       gethostid() returns the 32-bit identifier for the current host as set by sethostid().

       On success, sethostid() returns 0; on error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the
       error.

ERRORS
       sethostid() can fail with the following errors:

       EACCES The caller did not have permission to write to the file used to store the host ID.

       EPERM  The  calling process's effective user or group ID is not the same as its corresponding
              real ID.

CONFORMING TO
       4.2BSD;  these  functions  were  dropped  in  4.4BSD.   SVr4  includes  gethostid()  but  not
       sethostid().  POSIX.1-2001 specifies gethostid() but not sethostid().

NOTES
       In  the  glibc  implementation, the hostid is stored in the file /etc/hostid.  (In glibc ver‐
       sions before 2.2, the file /var/adm/hostid was used.)

       In the glibc implementation, if gethostid() cannot open the file containing the host ID, then
       it  obtains  the hostname using gethostname(2), passes that hostname to gethostbyname_r(3) in
       order to obtain the host's IPv4 address, and returns a value obtained  by  bit-twiddling  the
       IPv4 address.  (This value may not be unique.)

BUGS
       It is impossible to ensure that the identifier is globally unique.
