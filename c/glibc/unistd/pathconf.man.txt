FPATHCONF(3)                                      Linux Programmer's Manual                                     FPATHCONF(3)



NAME
       fpathconf, pathconf - get configuration values for files

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       long fpathconf(int fd, int name);
       long pathconf(char *path, int name);

DESCRIPTION
       fpathconf() gets a value for the configuration option name for the open file descriptor fd.

       pathconf() gets a value for configuration option name for the filename path.

       The  corresponding macros defined in <unistd.h> are minimum values; if an application wants to take advantage of val‐
       ues which may change, a call to fpathconf() or pathconf() can be made, which may yield more liberal results.

       Setting name equal to one of the following constants returns the following configuration options:

       _PC_LINK_MAX
              returns the maximum number of links to the file.  If fd or path refer to a directory, then the  value  applies
              to the whole directory.  The corresponding macro is _POSIX_LINK_MAX.

       _PC_MAX_CANON
              returns  the  maximum length of a formatted input line, where fd or path must refer to a terminal.  The corre‐
              sponding macro is _POSIX_MAX_CANON.

       _PC_MAX_INPUT
              returns the maximum length of an input line, where fd or path must refer to  a  terminal.   The  corresponding
              macro is _POSIX_MAX_INPUT.

       _PC_NAME_MAX
              returns  the  maximum  length of a filename in the directory path or fd that the process is allowed to create.
              The corresponding macro is _POSIX_NAME_MAX.

       _PC_PATH_MAX
              returns the maximum length of a relative pathname when path or fd is the current working directory.  The  cor‐
              responding macro is _POSIX_PATH_MAX.

       _PC_PIPE_BUF
              returns the size of the pipe buffer, where fd must refer to a pipe or FIFO and path must refer to a FIFO.  The
              corresponding macro is _POSIX_PIPE_BUF.

       _PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED
              returns nonzero if the chown(2) call may not be used on this file.  If fd or path refer to a  directory,  then
              this applies to all files in that directory.  The corresponding macro is _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED.

       _PC_NO_TRUNC
              returns  nonzero  if  accessing  filenames  longer than _POSIX_NAME_MAX generates an error.  The corresponding
              macro is _POSIX_NO_TRUNC.

       _PC_VDISABLE
              returns nonzero if special character processing can be disabled, where fd or path must refer to a terminal.

RETURN VALUE
       The limit is returned, if one exists.  If the system does not  have  a  limit  for  the  requested  resource,  -1  is
       returned,  and  errno  is unchanged.  If there is an error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to reflect the nature of
       the error.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Files with name lengths longer than the value returned for name equal to _PC_NAME_MAX may exist in the  given  direc‐
       tory.

       Some returned values may be huge; they are not suitable for allocating memory.
