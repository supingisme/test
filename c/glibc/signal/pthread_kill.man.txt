PTHREAD_KILL(3)                             Linux Programmer's Manual                            PTHREAD_KILL(3)



NAME
       pthread_kill - send a signal to a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int pthread_kill(pthread_t thread, int sig);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_kill()  function sends the signal sig to thread, a thread in the same process as the caller.
       The signal is asynchronously directed to thread.

       If sig is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking is still performed; this can be used to check for
       the existence of a thread ID.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_kill() returns 0; on error, it returns an error number, and no signal is sent.

ERRORS
       EINVAL An invalid signal was specified.

       ESRCH  No thread with the ID thread could be found.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Signal  dispositions  are  process-wide: if a signal handler is installed, the handler will be invoked in
       the thread thread, but if the disposition of the signal  is  "stop",  "continue",  or  "terminate",  this
       action will affect the whole process.
