RAISE(3)                                          Linux Programmer's Manual                                         RAISE(3)



NAME
       raise - send a signal to the caller

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int raise(int sig);

DESCRIPTION
       The  raise() function sends a signal to the calling process or thread.  In a single-threaded program it is equivalent
       to

           kill(getpid(), sig);

       In a multithreaded program it is equivalent to

           pthread_kill(pthread_self(), sig);

       If the signal causes a handler to be called, raise() will return only after the signal handler has returned.

RETURN VALUE
       raise() returns 0 on success, and nonzero for failure.

CONFORMING TO
       C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Since version 2.3.3, glibc implements raise() by calling tgkill(2), if the kernel supports that system  call.   Older
       glibc versions implemented raise() using kill(2).
