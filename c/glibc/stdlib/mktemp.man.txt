MKTEMP(3)                                         Linux Programmer's Manual                                        MKTEMP(3)



NAME
       mktemp - make a unique temporary filename

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *mktemp(char *template);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       mktemp():
           Since glibc 2.12:
               _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE ||
                   (_XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 ||
                        _XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED) &&
                   !(_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600)
           Before glibc 2.12:
               _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 || _XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

DESCRIPTION
       The  mktemp() function generates a unique temporary filename from template.  The last six characters of template must
       be XXXXXX and these are replaced with a string that makes the filename unique.  Since it will be  modified,  template
       must not be a string constant, but should be declared as a character array.

RETURN VALUE
       The  mktemp()  function  always  returns template.  If a unique name was created, the last six bytes of template will
       have been modified in such a way that the resulting name is unique (i.e., does not exist already) If  a  unique  name
       could not be created, template is made an empty string, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The last six characters of template were not XXXXXX.

CONFORMING TO
       4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of mktemp().

NOTES
       The  prototype  is  in  <unistd.h> for libc4, libc5, glibc1; glibc2 follows the Single UNIX Specification and has the
       prototype in <stdlib.h>.

BUGS
       Never use mktemp().  Some implementations follow 4.3BSD and replace XXXXXX by the current process  ID  and  a  single
       letter,  so  that at most 26 different names can be returned.  Since on the one hand the names are easy to guess, and
       on the other hand there is a race between testing whether the name exists and opening the file, every use of mktemp()
       is a security risk.  The race is avoided by mkstemp(3).
