MKDTEMP(3)                                        Linux Programmer's Manual                                       MKDTEMP(3)



NAME
       mkdtemp - create a unique temporary directory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *mkdtemp(char *template);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       mkdtemp():
           _BSD_SOURCE
           || /* Since glibc 2.10: */
               (_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700)

DESCRIPTION
       The mkdtemp() function generates a uniquely named temporary directory from template.  The last six characters of tem‐
       plate must be XXXXXX and these are replaced with a string that makes the directory name  unique.   The  directory  is
       then created with permissions 0700.  Since it will be modified, template must not be a string constant, but should be
       declared as a character array.

RETURN VALUE
       The mkdtemp() function returns a pointer to the modified template string on success, and NULL on  failure,  in  which
       case errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The last six characters of template were not XXXXXX.  Now template is unchanged.

       Also see mkdir(2) for other possible values for errno.

VERSIONS
       Available since glibc 2.1.91.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.  This function is present on the BSDs.
