DIRFD(3)                                          Linux Programmer's Manual                                         DIRFD(3)



NAME
       dirfd - get directory stream file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <dirent.h>

       int dirfd(DIR *dirp);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       dirfd():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE
           || /* Since glibc 2.10: */
               (_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700)

DESCRIPTION
       The function dirfd() returns the file descriptor associated with the directory stream dirp.

       This  descriptor  is  the  one used internally by the directory stream.  As a result, it is useful only for functions
       which do not depend on or alter the file position, such as fstat(2) and fchdir(2).  It will be  automatically  closed
       when closedir(3) is called.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  a  nonnegative file descriptor is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the
       cause of the error.

ERRORS
       POSIX.1-2008 specifies two errors, neither of which is returned by the current implementation.

       EINVAL dirp does not refer to a valid directory stream.

       ENOTSUP
              The implementation does not support the association of a file descriptor with a directory.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The dirfd() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.  This function was a BSD extension, present in 4.3BSD-Reno, not in 4.2BSD.

NOTES
       The prototype for dirfd() is available only if _BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE is defined.
