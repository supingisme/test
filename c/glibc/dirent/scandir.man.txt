SCANDIR(3)                                        Linux Programmer's Manual                                       SCANDIR(3)



NAME
       scandir, alphasort, versionsort - scan a directory for matching entries

SYNOPSIS
       #include <dirent.h>

       int scandir(const char *dirp, struct dirent ***namelist,
              int (*filter)(const struct dirent *),
              int (*compar)(const struct dirent **, const struct dirent **));

       int alphasort(const void *a, const void *b);

       int versionsort(const void *a, const void *b);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       scandir(), alphasort(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE
       versionsort(): _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  scandir()  function  scans the directory dirp, calling filter() on each directory entry.  Entries for which fil‐
       ter() returns nonzero are stored in strings allocated via malloc(3), sorted using qsort(3) with the comparison  func‐
       tion  compar(), and collected in array namelist which is allocated via malloc(3).  If filter is NULL, all entries are
       selected.

       The alphasort() and versionsort() functions can be used as the comparison function compar().  The former sorts direc‐
       tory entries using strcoll(3), the latter using strverscmp(3) on the strings (*a)->d_name and (*b)->d_name.

RETURN VALUE
       The scandir() function returns the number of directory entries selected.  On error, -1 is returned, with errno set to
       indicate the cause of the error.

       The alphasort() and versionsort() functions return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the  first
       argument is considered to be respectively less than, equal to, or greater than the second.

ERRORS
       ENOENT The path in dirp does not exist.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to complete the operation.

       ENOTDIR
              The path in dirp is not a directory.

VERSIONS
       versionsort() was added to glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       alphasort() and scandir() are specified in POSIX.1-2008, and are widely available.  versionsort() is a GNU extension.

       The  functions scandir() and alphasort() are from 4.3BSD, and have been available under Linux since libc4.  Libc4 and
       libc5 use the more precise prototype

           int alphasort(const struct dirent ** a,
                         const struct dirent **b);

       but glibc 2.0 returns to the imprecise BSD prototype.

       The function versionsort() is a GNU extension, available since glibc 2.1.

       Since glibc 2.1, alphasort() calls strcoll(3); earlier it used strcmp(3).

EXAMPLE
       #define _SVID_SOURCE
       /* print files in current directory in reverse order */
       #include <dirent.h>

       int
       main(void)
       {
           struct dirent **namelist;
           int n;

           n = scandir(".", &namelist, NULL, alphasort);
           if (n < 0)
               perror("scandir");
           else {
               while (n--) {
                   printf("%s\n", namelist[n]->d_name);
                   free(namelist[n]);
               }
               free(namelist);
           }
       }
