SETLOGMASK(3)                               Linux Programmer's Manual                              SETLOGMASK(3)



NAME
       setlogmask - set log priority mask

SYNOPSIS
       #include <syslog.h>

       int setlogmask(int mask);

DESCRIPTION
       A  process  has  a  log  priority mask that determines which calls to syslog(3) may be logged.  All other
       calls will be ignored.  Logging is enabled for the priorities that have  the  corresponding  bit  set  in
       mask.  The initial mask is such that logging is enabled for all priorities.

       The  setlogmask()  function sets this logmask for the calling process, and returns the previous mask.  If
       the mask argument is 0, the current logmask is not modified.

       The eight priorities are LOG_EMERG, LOG_ALERT, LOG_CRIT, LOG_ERR, LOG_WARNING, LOG_NOTICE, LOG_INFO,  and
       LOG_DEBUG.   The  bit  corresponding  to  a priority p is LOG_MASK(p).  Some systems also provide a macro
       LOG_UPTO(p) for the mask of all priorities in the above list up to and including p.

RETURN VALUE
       This function returns the previous log priority mask.

ERRORS
       None.

CONFORMING TO
