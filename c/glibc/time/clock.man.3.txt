CLOCK(3)                                    Linux Programmer's Manual                                   CLOCK(3)



NAME
       clock - determine processor time

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       clock_t clock(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The clock() function returns an approximation of processor time used by the program.

RETURN VALUE
       The value returned is the CPU time used so far as a clock_t; to get the number of seconds used, divide by
       CLOCKS_PER_SEC.  If the processor time used is not available or its  value  cannot  be  represented,  the
       function returns the value (clock_t) -1.

CONFORMING TO
       C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX requires that CLOCKS_PER_SEC equals 1000000 independent of the actual res‐
       olution.

NOTES
       The C standard allows for arbitrary values at the start of the program; subtract the value returned  from
       a call to clock() at the start of the program to get maximum portability.

       Note that the time can wrap around.  On a 32-bit system where CLOCKS_PER_SEC equals 1000000 this function
       will return the same value approximately every 72 minutes.

       On several other implementations, the value returned by clock() also includes the times of  any  children
       whose  status  has  been  collected  via wait(2) (or another wait-type call).  Linux does not include the
       times of waited-for children in the value returned by clock().  The times(2) function,  which  explicitly
       returns (separate) information about the caller and its children, may be preferable.
