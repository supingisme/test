SEM_DESTROY(3)                              Linux Programmer's Manual                             SEM_DESTROY(3)



NAME
       sem_destroy - destroy an unnamed semaphore

SYNOPSIS
       #include <semaphore.h>

       int sem_destroy(sem_t *sem);

       Link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       sem_destroy() destroys the unnamed semaphore at the address pointed to by sem.

       Only a semaphore that has been initialized by sem_init(3) should be destroyed using sem_destroy().

       Destroying a semaphore that other processes or threads are currently blocked on (in sem_wait(3)) produces
       undefined behavior.

       Using a semaphore that has been destroyed produces undefined results, until the semaphore has been reini‐
       tialized using sem_init(3).

RETURN VALUE
       sem_destroy() returns 0 on success; on error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL sem is not a valid semaphore.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       An  unnamed  semaphore should be destroyed with sem_destroy() before the memory in which it is located is
       deallocated.  Failure to do this can result in resource leaks on some implementations.
