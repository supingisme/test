PTHREAD_SIGQUEUE(3)                         Linux Programmer's Manual                        PTHREAD_SIGQUEUE(3)



NAME
       pthread_sigqueue - queue a signal and data to a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_sigqueue(pthread_t *thread, int sig,
                            const union sigval value);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       pthread_sigqueue(): _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_sigqueue() function performs a similar task to sigqueue(3), but, rather than sending a signal
       to a process, it sends a signal to a thread in the same process as the calling thread.

       The thread argument is the ID of a thread in the same process as the caller.  The sig argument  specifies
       the  signal  to  be sent.  The value argument specifies data to accompany the signal; see sigqueue(3) for
       details.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_sigqueue() returns 0; on error, it returns an error number.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN The limit of signals which may be queued has been reached.  (See signal(7)  for  further  informa‐
              tion.)

       EINVAL sig was invalid.

       ENOSYS pthread_sigqueue() is not supported on this system.

       ESRCH  thread is not valid.

VERSIONS
       The pthread_sigqueue() function first appeared in glibc 2.11.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.
