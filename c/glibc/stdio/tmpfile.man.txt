TMPFILE(3)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 TMPFILE(3)



NAME
       tmpfile - create a temporary file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       FILE *tmpfile(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The  tmpfile()  function opens a unique temporary file in binary read/write (w+b) mode.  The file will be
       automatically deleted when it is closed or the program terminates.

RETURN VALUE
       The tmpfile() function returns a stream descriptor, or NULL if a unique filename cannot be  generated  or
       the unique file cannot be opened.  In the latter case, errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EACCES Search permission denied for directory in file's path prefix.

       EEXIST Unable to generate a unique filename.

       EINTR  The call was interrupted by a signal.

       EMFILE Too many file descriptors in use by the process.

       ENFILE Too many files open in the system.

       ENOSPC There was no room in the directory to add the new filename.

       EROFS  Read-only file system.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99, SUSv2, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       POSIX.1-2001 specifies: an error message may be written to stdout if the stream cannot be opened.

       The  standard  does  not  specify  the directory that tmpfile() will use.  Glibc will try the path prefix
       P_tmpdir defined in <stdio.h>, and if that fails the directory /tmp.
