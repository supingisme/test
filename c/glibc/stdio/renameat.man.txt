RENAMEAT(2)                                 Linux Programmer's Manual                                RENAMEAT(2)



NAME
       renameat - rename a file relative to directory file descriptors

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fcntl.h> /* Definition of AT_* constants */
       #include <stdio.h>

       int renameat(int olddirfd, const char *oldpath,
                    int newdirfd, const char *newpath);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       renameat():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _ATFILE_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  renameat()  system  call  operates  in exactly the same way as rename(2), except for the differences
       described in this manual page.

       If the pathname given in oldpath is relative, then it is interpreted relative to the  directory  referred
       to  by the file descriptor olddirfd (rather than relative to the current working directory of the calling
       process, as is done by rename(2) for a relative pathname).

       If oldpath is relative and olddirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then oldpath is  interpreted  relative
       to the current working directory of the calling process (like rename(2)).

       If oldpath is absolute, then olddirfd is ignored.

       The  interpretation of newpath is as for oldpath, except that a relative pathname is interpreted relative
       to the directory referred to by the file descriptor newdirfd.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, renameat() returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The same errors that occur for rename(2) can also occur for renameat().  The following additional  errors
       can occur for renameat():

       EBADF  olddirfd or newdirfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOTDIR
              oldpath  is relative and olddirfd is a file descriptor referring to a file other than a directory;
              or similar for newpath and newdirfd

VERSIONS
       renameat() was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16; library support was added to glibc in version 2.4.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for renameat().
