NAME
       ldap - OpenLDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol API

LIBRARY
       OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ldap.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) (RFC 4510) provides access to X.500 directory services.
       These services may be stand-alone or part of a distributed directory service.  This client  API  supports
       LDAP  over TCP (RFC 4511), LDAP over TLS/SSL, and LDAP over IPC (UNIX domain sockets).  This API supports
       SASL (RFC 4513) and Start TLS (RFC 4513) as well as a number of protocol extensions.  This API is loosely
       based upon IETF/LDAPEXT C LDAP API draft specification, a (orphaned) work in progress.

       The  OpenLDAP  Software  package  includes a stand-alone server in slapd(8), various LDAP clients, and an
       LDAP client library used to provide programmatic access to the LDAP protocol.  This  man  page  gives  an
       overview of the LDAP library routines.

       Both  synchronous  and  asynchronous  APIs are provided.  Also included are various routines to parse the
       results returned from these routines.  These routines are found in the -lldap library.

       The basic interaction is as follows.  A session handle is created using ldap_initialize(3)  and  set  the
       protocol  version to 3 by calling ldap_set_option(3).  The underlying session is established first opera‐
       tion is issued.  This would generally be a Start TLS or Bind operation, or a  Search  operation  to  read
       attributes  of  the Root DSE.  A Start TLS operation is performed by calling ldap_start_tls_s(3).  A LDAP
       bind operation is performed by calling ldap_sasl_bind(3) or one of its friends.  A  Search  operation  is
       performed by calling ldap_search_ext_s(3) or one of its friends.

       Subsequently,  additional operations are performed by calling one of the synchronous or asynchronous rou‐
       tines (e.g., ldap_compare_ext_s(3) or ldap_compare_ext(3) followed by ldap_result(3)).  Results  returned
       from  these  routines  are interpreted by calling the LDAP parsing routines such as ldap_parse_result(3).
       The LDAP association and underlying connection is terminated by calling ldap_unbind_ext(3).   Errors  can
       be interpreted by calling ldap_err2string(3).

LDAP versions
       This  library  supports version 3 of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAPv3) as defined in RFC
       4510.  It also supports a variant of version 2 of LDAP as defined by U-Mich LDAP and, to some degree, RFC
       1777.  Version 2 (all variants) are considered obsolete.  Version 3 should be used instead.

       For backwards compatibility reasons, the library defaults to version 2.  Hence, all new applications (and
       all actively maintained applications) should use ldap_set_option(3) to select  version  3.   The  library
       manual pages assume version 3 has been selected.

INPUT and OUTPUT PARAMETERS
       All character string input/output is expected to be/is UTF-8 encoded Unicode (version 3.2).

       Distinguished names (DN) (and relative distinguished names (RDN) to be passed to the LDAP routines should
       conform to RFC 4514 UTF-8 string representation.

       Search filters to be passed to the search routines are to be constructed by hand and  should  conform  to
       RFC 4515 UTF-8 string representation.

       LDAP  URLs to be passed to routines are expected to conform to RFC 4516 format.  The ldap_url(3) routines
       can be used to work with LDAP URLs.

       LDAP controls to be passed to routines can be manipulated using the ldap_controls(3) routines.

DISPLAYING RESULTS
       Results obtained from the search routines can be output  by  hand,  by  calling  ldap_first_entry(3)  and
       ldap_next_entry(3)    to    step    through    the    entries   returned,   ldap_first_attribute(3)   and
       ldap_next_attribute(3) to step through an entry's attributes, and ldap_get_values(3) to retrieve a  given
       attribute's values.  Attribute values may or may not be displayable.

UTILITY ROUTINES
       Also  provided  are various utility routines.  The ldap_sort(3) routines are used to sort the entries and
       values returned via the ldap search routines.

DEPRECATED INTERFACES
       A number of interfaces are now considered deprecated.  For instance, ldap_add(3) is deprecated  in  favor
       of  ldap_add_ext(3).   Deprecated  interfaces generally remain in the library.  The macro LDAP_DEPRECATED
       can be defined to a non-zero value (e.g., -DLDAP_DEPRECATED=1) when compiling  program  designed  to  use
       deprecated interfaces.  It is recommended that developers writing new programs, or updating old programs,
       avoid use of deprecated interfaces.  Over time, it is expected that documentation (and, eventually,  sup‐
       port) for deprecated interfaces to be eliminated.

BER LIBRARY
       Also  included in the distribution is a set of lightweight Basic Encoding Rules routines.  These routines
       are used by the LDAP library routines to encode and decode LDAP protocol  elements  using  the  (slightly
       simplified)  Basic Encoding Rules defined by LDAP.  They are not normally used directly by an LDAP appli‐
       cation program except in the handling of controls and extended operations.  The routines provide a printf
       and scanf-like interface, as well as lower-level access.  These routines are discussed in lber-decode(3),
       lber-encode(3), lber-memory(3), and lber-types(3).
