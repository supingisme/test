NAME
       dladdr, dlclose, dlerror, dlopen, dlsym, dlvsym - programming interface to dynamic linking loader

SYNOPSIS
       #include <dlfcn.h>

       void *dlopen(const char *filename, int flag);

       char *dlerror(void);

       void *dlsym(void *handle, const char *symbol);

       int dlclose(void *handle);

       Link with -ldl.

DESCRIPTION
       The four functions dlopen(), dlsym(), dlclose(), dlerror() implement the interface to the dynamic linking loader.

   dlerror()
       The  function  dlerror()  returns  a  human  readable  string describing the most recent error that occurred from dlopen(), dlsym() or
       dlclose() since the last call to dlerror().  It returns NULL if no errors have occurred since initialization  or  since  it  was  last
       called.

   dlopen()
       The  function  dlopen() loads the dynamic library file named by the null-terminated string filename and returns an opaque "handle" for
       the dynamic library.  If filename is NULL, then the returned handle is for the main program.  If filename contains a slash ("/"), then
       it  is  interpreted  as  a  (relative  or  absolute) pathname.  Otherwise, the dynamic linker searches for the library as follows (see
       ld.so(8) for further details):

       o   (ELF only) If the executable file for the calling program contains a DT_RPATH tag, and does not contain a DT_RUNPATH tag, then the
           directories listed in the DT_RPATH tag are searched.

       o   If,  at  the  time that the program was started, the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH was defined to contain a colon-separated
           list of directories, then these are searched.  (As a security measure this variable is ignored for  set-user-ID  and  set-group-ID
           programs.)

       o   (ELF  only)  If the executable file for the calling program contains a DT_RUNPATH tag, then the directories listed in that tag are
           searched.

       o   The cache file /etc/ld.so.cache (maintained by ldconfig(8)) is checked to see whether it contains an entry for filename.

       o   The directories /lib and /usr/lib are searched (in that order).

       If the library has dependencies on other shared libraries, then these are also automatically loaded by the dynamic  linker  using  the
       same rules.  (This process may occur recursively, if those libraries in turn have dependencies, and so on.)

       One of the following two values must be included in flag:

       RTLD_LAZY
              Perform  lazy  binding.  Only resolve symbols as the code that references them is executed.  If the symbol is never referenced,
              then it is never resolved.  (Lazy binding is performed only for function references; references to variables are always immedi‐
              ately bound when the library is loaded.)

       RTLD_NOW
              If  this  value is specified, or the environment variable LD_BIND_NOW is set to a nonempty string, all undefined symbols in the
              library are resolved before dlopen() returns.  If this cannot be done, an error is returned.

       Zero or more of the following values may also be ORed in flag:

       RTLD_GLOBAL
              The symbols defined by this library will be made available for symbol resolution of subsequently loaded libraries.

       RTLD_LOCAL
              This is the converse of RTLD_GLOBAL, and the default if neither flag is specified.  Symbols defined in  this  library  are  not
              made available to resolve references in subsequently loaded libraries.

       RTLD_NODELETE (since glibc 2.2)
              Do  not unload the library during dlclose().  Consequently, the library's static variables are not reinitialized if the library
              is reloaded with dlopen() at a later time.  This flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001.

       RTLD_NOLOAD (since glibc 2.2)
              Don't load the library.  This can be used to test if the library is already resident (dlopen() returns NULL if it  is  not,  or
              the  library's handle if it is resident).  This flag can also be used to promote the flags on a library that is already loaded.
              For example, a library that was previously loaded with RTLD_LOCAL can be reopened with RTLD_NOLOAD | RTLD_GLOBAL.  This flag is
              not specified in POSIX.1-2001.

       RTLD_DEEPBIND (since glibc 2.3.4)
              Place the lookup scope of the symbols in this library ahead of the global scope.  This means that a self-contained library will
              use its own symbols in preference to global symbols with the same name contained in libraries that have  already  been  loaded.
              This flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001.

       If  filename  is a NULL pointer, then the returned handle is for the main program.  When given to dlsym(), this handle causes a search
       for a symbol in the main program, followed by all shared libraries loaded at program startup, and then all shared libraries loaded  by
       dlopen() with the flag RTLD_GLOBAL.

       External  references  in the library are resolved using the libraries in that library's dependency list and any other libraries previ‐
       ously  opened  with  the  RTLD_GLOBAL  flag.   If  the  executable  was  linked  with  the   flag   "-rdynamic"   (or,   synonymously,
       "--export-dynamic"),  then  the  global  symbols  in  the  executable  will also be used to resolve references in a dynamically loaded
       library.

       If the same library is loaded again with dlopen(), the same file handle is returned.  The dl library maintains  reference  counts  for
       library handles, so a dynamic library is not deallocated until dlclose() has been called on it as many times as dlopen() has succeeded
       on it.  The _init() routine, if present, is called only once.  But a subsequent call with RTLD_NOW may force symbol resolution  for  a
       library earlier loaded with RTLD_LAZY.

       If dlopen() fails for any reason, it returns NULL.

   dlsym()
       The  function  dlsym()  takes  a "handle" of a dynamic library returned by dlopen() and the null-terminated symbol name, returning the
       address where that symbol is loaded into memory.  If the symbol is not found, in the specified library or any of  the  libraries  that
       were automatically loaded by dlopen() when that library was loaded, dlsym() returns NULL.  (The search performed by dlsym() is breadth
       first through the dependency tree of these libraries.)  Since the value of the symbol could actually be NULL (so that  a  NULL  return
       from dlsym() need not indicate an error), the correct way to test for an error is to call dlerror() to clear any old error conditions,
       then call dlsym(), and then call dlerror() again, saving its return value into a variable, and check whether this saved value  is  not
       NULL.

       There  are  two  special  pseudo-handles, RTLD_DEFAULT and RTLD_NEXT.  The former will find the first occurrence of the desired symbol
       using the default library search order.  The latter will find the next occurrence of a function in the search order after the  current
       library.  This allows one to provide a wrapper around a function in another shared library.

   dlclose()
       The  function dlclose() decrements the reference count on the dynamic library handle handle.  If the reference count drops to zero and
       no other loaded libraries use symbols in it, then the dynamic library is unloaded.

       The function dlclose() returns 0 on success, and nonzero on error.

   The obsolete symbols _init() and _fini()
       The linker recognizes special symbols _init and _fini.  If a dynamic library exports a routine named _init(), then that code  is  exe‐
       cuted after the loading, before dlopen() returns.  If the dynamic library exports a routine named _fini(), then that routine is called
       just before the library is unloaded.  In case you need to avoid linking against the system startup files, this can be  done  by  using
       the gcc(1) -nostartfiles command-line option.

       Using  these routines, or the gcc -nostartfiles or -nostdlib options, is not recommended.  Their use may result in undesired behavior,
       since the constructor/destructor routines will not be executed (unless special measures are taken).

       Instead, libraries should export routines using the __attribute__((constructor)) and __attribute__((destructor)) function  attributes.
       See  the  gcc info pages for information on these.  Constructor routines are executed before dlopen() returns, and destructor routines
       are executed before dlclose() returns.

   Glibc extensions: dladdr() and dlvsym()
       Glibc adds two functions not described by POSIX, with prototypes

       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <dlfcn.h>

       int dladdr(void *addr, Dl_info *info);

       void *dlvsym(void *handle, char *symbol, char *version);

       The function dladdr() takes a function pointer and tries to resolve name and file where it is located.  Information is stored  in  the
       Dl_info structure:

           typedef struct {
               const char *dli_fname;  /* Pathname of shared object that
                                          contains address */
               void       *dli_fbase;  /* Address at which shared object
                                          is loaded */
               const char *dli_sname;  /* Name of nearest symbol with address
                                          lower than addr */
               void       *dli_saddr;  /* Exact address of symbol named
                                          in dli_sname */
           } Dl_info;

       If no symbol matching addr could be found, then dli_sname and dli_saddr are set to NULL.

       dladdr() returns 0 on error, and nonzero on success.

       The function dlvsym(), provided by glibc since version 2.1, does the same as dlsym() but takes a version string as an additional argu‐
       ment.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001 describes dlclose(), dlerror(), dlopen(), and dlsym().

NOTES
       The symbols RTLD_DEFAULT and RTLD_NEXT are defined by <dlfcn.h> only when _GNU_SOURCE was defined before including it.

       Since glibc 2.2.3, atexit(3) can be used to register an exit handler that is automatically called when a library is unloaded.

   History
       The dlopen interface standard comes from SunOS.  That system also has dladdr(), but not dlvsym().

BUGS
       Sometimes, the function pointers you pass to dladdr() may surprise you.  On some architectures (notably i386  and  x86_64),  dli_fname
       and  dli_fbase  may end up pointing back at the object from which you called dladdr(), even if the function used as an argument should
       come from a dynamically linked library.

       The problem is that the function pointer will still be resolved at compile time, but merely point to the plt (Procedure Linkage Table)
       section  of  the  original  object  (which dispatches the call after asking the dynamic linker to resolve the symbol).  To work around
       this, you can try to compile the code to be position-independent: then, the compiler cannot prepare the pointer at compile  time  any‐
       more  and  today's  gcc(1)  will generate code that just loads the final symbol address from the got (Global Offset Table) at run time
       before passing it to dladdr().

EXAMPLE
       Load the math library, and print the cosine of 2.0:

       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <stdlib.h>
       #include <dlfcn.h>

       int
       main(int argc, char **argv)
       {
           void *handle;
           double (*cosine)(double);
           char *error;

           handle = dlopen("libm.so", RTLD_LAZY);
           if (!handle) {
               fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", dlerror());
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           dlerror();    /* Clear any existing error */

           /* Writing: cosine = (double (*)(double)) dlsym(handle, "cos");
              would seem more natural, but the C99 standard leaves
              casting from "void *" to a function pointer undefined.
              The assignment used below is the POSIX.1-2003 (Technical
              Corrigendum 1) workaround; see the Rationale for the
              POSIX specification of dlsym(). */

           *(void **) (&cosine) = dlsym(handle, "cos");

           if ((error = dlerror()) != NULL)  {
               fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", error);
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           printf("%f\n", (*cosine)(2.0));
           dlclose(handle);
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }

       If this program were in a file named "foo.c", you would build the program with the following command:

           gcc -rdynamic -o foo foo.c -ldl

       Libraries exporting _init() and _fini() will want to be compiled as follows, using bar.c as the example name:

           gcc -shared -nostartfiles -o bar bar.c
