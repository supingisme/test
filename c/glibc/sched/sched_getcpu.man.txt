SCHED_GETCPU(3)                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                  SCHED_GETCPU(3)



NAME
       sched_getcpu - determine CPU on which the calling thread is running

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sched.h>

       int sched_getcpu(void);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       sched_getcpu():
           Since glibc 2.14:
               _GNU_SOURCE
           Before glibc 2.14:
               _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE
                   /* _GNU_SOURCE also suffices */

DESCRIPTION
       sched_getcpu() returns the number of the CPU on which the calling thread is currently executing.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  sched_getcpu() returns a nonnegative CPU number.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate
       the error.

ERRORS
       ENOSYS This kernel does not implement getcpu(2).

VERSIONS
       This function is available since glibc 2.6.

CONFORMING TO
       sched_getcpu() is glibc specific.

NOTES
       The call

           cpu = sched_getcpu();

       is equivalent to the following getcpu(2) call:

           int c, s;
           s = getcpu(&c, NULL, NULL);
           cpu = (s == -1) ? s : c;

SEE ALSO
       getcpu(2)
