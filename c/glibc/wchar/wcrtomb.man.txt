WCRTOMB(3)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 WCRTOMB(3)



NAME
       wcrtomb - convert a wide character to a multibyte sequence

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t wcrtomb(char *s, wchar_t wc, mbstate_t *ps);

DESCRIPTION
       The  main  case  for this function is when s is not NULL and wc is not a null wide character (L'\0').  In
       this case, the wcrtomb() function converts the wide character wc  to  its  multibyte  representation  and
       stores  it  at the beginning of the character array pointed to by s.  It updates the shift state *ps, and
       returns the length of said multibyte representation, that is, the number of bytes written at s.

       A different case is when s is not NULL, but wc is a null wide character (L'\0').  In this case  the  wcr‐
       tomb() function stores at the character array pointed to by s the shift sequence needed to bring *ps back
       to the initial state, followed by a '\0' byte.  It updates the shift state *ps (i.e., brings it into  the
       initial state), and returns the length of the shift sequence plus one, that is, the number of bytes writ‐
       ten at s.

       A third case is when s is NULL.  In this case wc is ignored, and the function effectively returns

           wcrtomb(buf, L'\0', ps)

       where buf is an internal anonymous buffer.

       In all of the above cases, if ps is a NULL pointer, a static anonymous state known only to the  wcrtomb()
       function is used instead.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcrtomb() function returns the number of bytes that have been or would have been written to the byte
       array at s.  If wc can not be represented as a multibyte sequence  (according  to  the  current  locale),
       (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno set to EILSEQ.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of wcrtomb() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.

       Passing NULL as ps is not multithread safe.
