STPCPY(3)                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                  STPCPY(3)



NAME
       stpcpy - copy a string returning a pointer to its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *stpcpy(char *dest, const char *src);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       stpcpy():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The stpcpy() function copies the string pointed to by src (including the terminating null byte ('\0')) to
       the array pointed to by dest.  The strings may not overlap, and the destination string dest must be large
       enough to receive the copy.

RETURN VALUE
       stpcpy()  returns  a  pointer to the end of the string dest (that is, the address of the terminating null
       byte) rather than the beginning.

CONFORMING TO
       This function was added to POSIX.1-2008.  Before that, it was not part of the C or POSIX.1 standards, nor
       customary  on UNIX systems, but was not a GNU invention either.  Perhaps it came from MS-DOS.  It is also
       present on the BSDs.

BUGS
       This function may overrun the buffer dest.

EXAMPLE
       For example, this program uses stpcpy() to concatenate foo and bar  to  produce  foobar,  which  it  then
       prints.

           #define _GNU_SOURCE
           #include <string.h>
           #include <stdio.h>

           int
           main(void)
           {
               char buffer[20];
               char *to = buffer;

               to = stpcpy(to, "foo");
               to = stpcpy(to, "bar");
               printf("%s\n", buffer);
           }
