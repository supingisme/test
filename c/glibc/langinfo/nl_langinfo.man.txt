NL_LANGINFO(3)                              Linux Programmer's Manual                             NL_LANGINFO(3)



NAME
       nl_langinfo - query language and locale information

SYNOPSIS
       #include <langinfo.h>

       char *nl_langinfo(nl_item item);

DESCRIPTION
       The  nl_langinfo()  function  provides  access  to locale information in a more flexible way than locale‐
       conv(3) does.  Individual and additional elements of the locale categories can be queried.

       Examples for the locale elements that can be specified in item using  the  constants  defined  in  <lang‐
       info.h> are:

       CODESET (LC_CTYPE)
              Return  a  string  with  the  name  of the character encoding used in the selected locale, such as
              "UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1", or "ANSI_X3.4-1968" (better known as US-ASCII).  This is  the  same  string
              that  you get with "locale charmap".  For a list of character encoding names, try "locale -m", cf.
              locale(1).

       D_T_FMT (LC_TIME)
              Return a string that can be used as a format string for strftime(3) to represent time and date  in
              a locale-specific way.

       D_FMT (LC_TIME)
              Return  a  string  that  can  be  used as a format string for strftime(3) to represent a date in a
              locale-specific way.

       T_FMT (LC_TIME)
              Return a string that can be used as a format string for strftime(3)  to  represent  a  time  in  a
              locale-specific way.

       DAY_{1–7} (LC_TIME)
              Return  name of the n-th day of the week. [Warning: this follows the US convention DAY_1 = Sunday,
              not the international convention (ISO 8601) that Monday is the first day of the week.]

       ABDAY_{1–7} (LC_TIME)
              Return abbreviated name of the n-th day of the week.

       MON_{1–12} (LC_TIME)
              Return name of the n-th month.

       ABMON_{1–12} (LC_TIME)
              Return abbreviated name of the n-th month.

       RADIXCHAR (LC_NUMERIC)
              Return radix character (decimal dot, decimal comma, etc.).

       THOUSEP (LC_NUMERIC)
              Return separator character for thousands (groups of three digits).

       YESEXPR (LC_MESSAGES)
              Return a regular expression that can be used with the regex(3) function to  recognize  a  positive
              response to a yes/no question.

       NOEXPR (LC_MESSAGES)
              Return  a  regular  expression that can be used with the regex(3) function to recognize a negative
              response to a yes/no question.

       CRNCYSTR (LC_MONETARY)
              Return the currency symbol, preceded by "-" if the symbol should appear before the value,  "+"  if
              the symbol should appear after the value, or "." if the symbol should replace the radix character.

       The  above list covers just some examples of items that can be requested.  For a more detailed list, con‐
       sult The GNU C Library Reference Manual.

RETURN VALUE
       If no locale has been selected by setlocale(3) for the  appropriate  category,  nl_langinfo()  returns  a
       pointer to the corresponding string in the "C" locale.

       If item is not valid, a pointer to an empty string is returned.

       This pointer may point to static data that may be overwritten on the next call to nl_langinfo() or setlo‐
       cale(3).

CONFORMING TO
       SUSv2, POSIX.1-2001.

EXAMPLE
       The following program sets the character type locale according to the environment and queries the  termi‐
       nal character set.

       #include <langinfo.h>
       #include <locale.h>
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           setlocale(LC_CTYPE,"");
           printf("%s\n",nl_langinfo(CODESET));
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
