       lgamma():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE || _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99
       lgammaf(), lgammal():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99
       lgamma_r(), lgammaf_r(), lgammal_r():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE
       signgam:
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       For the definition of the Gamma function, see tgamma(3).

       The  lgamma()  function  returns  the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the Gamma function.  The
       sign of the Gamma function is returned in the external integer signgam declared in  <math.h>.   It  is  1
       when the Gamma function is positive or zero, -1 when it is negative.

       Since  using  a  constant  location  signgam  is not thread-safe, the functions lgamma_r() etc. have been
       introduced; they return the sign via the argument signp.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the natural logarithm of Gamma(x).

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is 1 or 2, +0 is returned.

       If x is positive infinity or negative infinity, positive infinity is returned.

       If x is a nonpositive integer, a pole error occurs, and the functions return  +HUGE_VAL,  +HUGE_VALF,  or
       +HUGE_VALL, respectively.

       If  the  result  overflows,  a  range  error  occurs,  and  the  functions return HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or
       HUGE_VALL, respectively, with the correct mathematical sign.

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred  when  calling  these
       functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Pole error: x is a nonpositive integer
              errno  is  set to ERANGE (but see BUGS).  A divide-by-zero floating-point exception (FE_DIVBYZERO)
              is raised.

       Range error: result overflow
              errno is set to ERANGE.  An overflow floating-point exception (FE_OVERFLOW) is raised.

CONFORMING TO
       The lgamma() functions are specified in C99 and POSIX.1-2001.  signgam is specified in POSIX.1-2001,  but
       not in C99.  The lgamma_r() functions are nonstandard, but present on several other systems.

BUGS
       In  glibc  2.9 and earlier, when a pole error occurs, errno is set to EDOM; instead of the POSIX-mandated
       ERANGE.  Since version 2.10, glibc does the right thing.
