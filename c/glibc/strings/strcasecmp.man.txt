STRCASECMP(3)                               Linux Programmer's Manual                              STRCASECMP(3)



NAME
       strcasecmp, strncasecmp - compare two strings ignoring case

SYNOPSIS
       #include <strings.h>

       int strcasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);

       int strncasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strcasecmp()  function  compares the two strings s1 and s2, ignoring the case of the characters.  It
       returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if s1 is found,  respectively,  to  be  less
       than, to match, or be greater than s2.

       The strncasecmp() function is similar, except it compares the only first n bytes of s1.

RETURN VALUE
       The  strcasecmp() and strncasecmp() functions return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero
       if s1 (or the first n bytes thereof) is found, respectively, to be less than, to  match,  or  be  greater
       than s2.

CONFORMING TO
