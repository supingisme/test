NAME
       bcopy - copy byte sequence

SYNOPSIS
       #include <strings.h>

       void bcopy(const void *src, void *dest, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  bcopy() function copies n bytes from src to dest.  The result is correct, even when both areas over‐
       lap.

RETURN VALUE
       None.

CONFORMING TO
       4.3BSD.  This function is deprecated (marked as LEGACY in POSIX.1-2001): use memcpy(3) or  memmove(3)  in
       new  programs.   Note  that  the  first  two  arguments  are  interchanged  for memcpy(3) and memmove(3).
       POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of bcopy().
