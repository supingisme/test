REXEC(3)                                    Linux Programmer's Manual                                   REXEC(3)



NAME
       rexec, rexec_af - return stream to a remote command

SYNOPSIS
       #define _BSD_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <netdb.h>

       int rexec(char **ahost, int inport, char *user,
                 char *passwd, char *cmd, int *fd2p);

       int rexec_af(char **ahost, int inport, char *user,
                    char *passwd, char *cmd, int *fd2p,
                    sa_family_t af);

DESCRIPTION
       This interface is obsoleted by rcmd(3).

       The  rexec()  function looks up the host *ahost using gethostbyname(3), returning -1 if the host does not
       exist.  Otherwise *ahost is set to the standard name of the host.  If a username and  password  are  both
       specified,  then  these  are used to authenticate to the foreign host; otherwise the environment and then
       the user's .netrc file in his home directory are searched  for  appropriate  information.   If  all  this
       fails, the user is prompted for the information.

       The  port  inport specifies which well-known DARPA Internet port to use for the connection; the call get‐
       servbyname("exec", "tcp") (see getservent(3)) will return a pointer to a structure that contains the nec‐
       essary port.  The protocol for connection is described in detail in rexecd(8).

       If  the connection succeeds, a socket in the Internet domain of type SOCK_STREAM is returned to the call‐
       er, and given to the remote command as stdin and stdout.  If fd2p is nonzero, then an  auxiliary  channel
       to a control process will be setup, and a descriptor for it will be placed in *fd2p.  The control process
       will return diagnostic output from the command (unit 2) on this channel, and will also  accept  bytes  on
       this  channel  as  being  UNIX  signal numbers, to be forwarded to the process group of the command.  The
       diagnostic information returned does not include remote authorization failure, as the  secondary  connec‐
       tion  is  set  up  after  authorization  has been verified.  If fd2p is 0, then the stderr (unit 2 of the
       remote command) will be made the same as the stdout and no provision is made for sending  arbitrary  sig‐
       nals to the remote process, although you may be able to get its attention by using out-of-band data.

   rexec_af()
       The  rexec()  function works over IPv4 (AF_INET).  By contrast, the rexec_af() function provides an extra
       argument, af, that allows the caller to select the protocol.  This argument can be specified as  AF_INET,
       AF_INET6, or AF_UNSPEC (to allow the implementation to select the protocol).

VERSIONS
       The rexec_af() function was added to glibc in version 2.2.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The rexec() and rexec_af() functions are not thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       These  functions  are not in POSIX.1-2001.  The rexec() function first appeared in 4.2BSD, and is present
       on the BSDs, Solaris, and many other systems.  The rexec_af() function is more  recent,  and  less  wide‐
       spread.

BUGS
       The rexec() function sends the unencrypted password across the network.

       The  underlying  service  is  considered a big security hole and therefore not enabled on many sites; see
       rexecd(8) for explanations.
